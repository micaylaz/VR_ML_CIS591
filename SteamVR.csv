Im not sure why they NEED it to be on C: (or maybe whatever drive steam is installed on) but seems odd. All of the games that I play in SteamVR can be moved just not SteamVR itself.        I never got to a workaround as it wasnt a huge deal to me I was just organizing files and SteamVR isnt exactly too huge so I left it as is.        Feels like they hardcoded something in that they shouldnt have yet they know enough about to prevent you from moving it.

Dont know if its changed but you just look like another flat player so I was worried Id have to keep explaining why I was struggling because VR controls are almost never going to be as quick as mouse/kb.   But they were actually super smooth and I rarely did. Even gives a few advantages like being able to interact with the drill with one hand while aiming and shooting with the other which you cant do in flat. I felt like that balanced it enough to make VR feel fair alongside flat at least for me who doesnt play that game much to begin with.','i4eh315','/r/SteamVR/comments/u1qlwm/what_happened_to_the_gta_v_vr_mod_with_motion/i4g9nbm/'

'i4gqjsi','2022-04-12 11:54:07','thegenregeek','u23alh','Come on Base station is restock but still no controller!!!','So its not the best solution but Valve does sell the Replacement versions of the controllers. ([Left](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1615160/Valve_Index_Replacement_Left_Controller/) and [Right](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1615180/Valve_Index_Replacement_Right_Controller/) though right is OOS at the moment).  Unfortunately buying both is about $30 more than the full kit. However it seems like they tend to be in stock separately from the full kit.   I ended up ordering one of each of those because I couldnt get the normal version during the last drop a couple of weeks ago.

Ive been mining on it for over a year and its more than paid for itself and hitting ultra with good FPS on anything.   In VR however I would think a 3070ti at a minimum but likely a 3080 is required to make the resolution look good at a decent FPS. Honestly for most games it would be incredible and perfect more than enough but in my case it was for sim racing. I have to run too low settings and there isnt enough pixel density to give me proper immersion.','i4ff3ui','/r/SteamVR/comments/mdczto/terrible_performance_3060_ti_and_quest_2/i4gulct/'

Some custom maps also vary in performance between updates.   Are you on Windows 11? There have been multiple VR related issues on Win11. Usually it shows as extreme stuttering but Ive also seen mentions of overall low performance.  Does your laptop have different power states? I can cycle my laptop between power save auto and max performance states. Refer to the manufacturer page for this.  And one last thing is that there was a post that compared Q2 performance with Index on same resolution and there was a drop on performance. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/tzq3m7/using_similar_res_index_is_30_40_faster_than)  If you want to get better performance you should first find out what resources are getting bottlenecked (maxed out).

You buy the best video card in the world and a better one comes out a month later. Its the nature of technology you cant really avoid it. You can either have a great vr experience now or you can wait forever for a better headset to come along.  Also a 3070 is totally fine for vr. You can spend twice as much for 5% more performance but the law of diminishing returns is real. If you really want to feel informed look at the benchmark tests. Check out how many more actual frames per second youre gonna get with a 3080 vs a 3070 and decide if its worth it.  [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-vs-3080](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-vs-3080)     Typically youre looking at an improvement of 15 frames per second on top of 110.

'i4bjj07','2022-04-11 10:38:45','Sabbathius','u153wo','Best VR Game released in past 12 months ?','For me standouts are After the Fall and Zenith. Lone Echo 2 was also good but WAY too short for what youre paying. And Resident Evil 4 port (Quest 2 Android only) was semi-decent.  After the Fall is buggy as hell and the player base is basically dead. I routinely have to wait 5+ mins for a group and even longer for Nightmare difficulty. But I do like the visuals and the gameplay is decent. Nothing special but it tickles the same spot as Left 4 Dead did. I cant exactly recommend it for anyone in its current state but I do fire it up on occasion. Came out last December.  Zenith is very early days its Early Access came out late January. Still very heavy on placeholders and tons of broken stuff bad balance missing mechanics low content. But it somehow ticked the same spot as very early days of vanilla WoW. Which was also incredibly buggy and poorly balanced at launch and for several years thereafter. Again cant really recommend it exactly. Not in its current state. But its very promising and I fire it up in short bursts now and again.  I dont think we really got any best VR games in a while. Alyx was really good. Before Alyx I would argue Asgards Wrath back in 2019 (another Oculus exclusive like Lone Echo 2) was very good also. But for the most part its bad ports and low-effort shovelware. VR gaming scene has been bordering on pathetic for many years now. Heck my most-played VR game after all this time is still No Mans Sky its a semi-decent port from August 2019. Followed by Fallout 4 and Skyrim.  Theres been quite a few indies like Sweet Surrender Ancient Dungeon Legendary Tales Outlier etc. but I very seldom go for those. They tend to  be pretty derivative and ultimately quite shallow and short. Im still waiting to see if Blade & Sorcery will finally evolve this year into an actual game or if it will remain just another tech demo.  The sad thing is I dont see anything thats been announced in detail that might blow my kilt up. Theres rumors of Assassins Creed and Splinter Cell but given what they did with Far Cry VR Im not exactly excited for it.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u153wo/best_vr_game_released_in_past_12_months/i4bjj07/'

'i4s7p77','2022-04-14 19:21:56','VonHagenstein','u3n8nj','What’s the best VR headset your ever used？','Too subjective of a question especially since all current HMD are compromises in some way.  LCD-based screens with poor blacks but high refresh rates.  OLED screens with inky blacks and great color but lower resolution and terrible SDE.  High resolution but low FOV.  High FOV at the cost of decreased visual fidelity or distortion issues and steep system requirements.  Or maybe it has a high horizontal FOV but a low vertical FOV (looking at you Vive Pro 2).  Or perhaps it has great clarity but smaller FOV and lower quality controller tracking (HP Reverb G2).  Etc. etc.  Best will mean different things to different people.  The Valve Index is probably the best all rounder with great good or good-enough implementations of most of the specs that most users value.  But its blacks are dark grey it has worse fresnel lens glare than some of its competitors its resolution is starting to lag behind the latest greatest and there is no wireless option.  But dont misunderstand those deficiencies.  It still has great clarity supports up to 144hz refresh rates has a larger FOV than most others excepting the Pimax HMDs best-in-class audio best-in-class Lighthouse tracking and is well-balanced and comfortable with some considering it one of the more comfortable HMDs available despite it not being the lightest.   So I would vote for the Index but thats just my opinion.  Others might prefer the bigger FOV of the Pimax HMDs or the clarity of the Reverb G2 (despite the lower FOV) or the untethered no-PC-required experience of the Quest (and they only cost a fraction of the price of other HMDs plus your immortal soul).','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u3n8nj/whats_the_best_vr_headset_your_ever_used/i4s7p77/'

Maybe even getting into reprojection but that should be too bad. Also overclocking probably wont do much since youll be constrained thermally from the laptop form factor. I guess I should also be asking but whats your GPU? That should matter more in this case. Also what do you mean input lag? And how do you know its 10 or 12 ms? Is that the frame time because if that is and frames arnt dropping or you are not into late frame territory (Which sounds like you may at worse be in reprojection) then its frankly not something to worry about.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4tj722/'

'i4toa09','2022-04-15 05:26:59','sdrft1','u42eyf','Why does my cpu keep on getting input lag?','If you are experiencing frame drops its not your CPU. A frame drop has many ways it occurs but the most common is a frame is rendered far to late for even a late frame timing and has to be dropped so the compositor can move onto the next frame. A drop is a serious event usually seen as a pink spike. If your seeing the occasional frame drop this is just like stuttering you would experience in a 2d game when assets are loaded into the GPU memory and during this thats why it has to drop the frame. Your 12/13 ms frame time is no where close to even a late frame being rendered but a reprojected frame. In order for a late frame the frame time of the pipeline must be at 40 fps rendered 25 ms or more almost double what you have. And in order for a frame to be dropped the frame must be rendered so late (typically 40 or more ms) that the headsets moved to far for reprojection to solve it and the frame must be dropped so the system can move onto the next frame. What you are describing either sounds like constant (As in about 25% or more of the frames are dropped) dropped frames in which case you need to update to the latest SteamVR beta 1.22.5 and turn oiff hardware accelerated Gpu scheduling or intermittent (Once every could of seconds or minutes) which point to either needing to use DDU to reinstall the latest Nvidia driver or theres nothing you can do about it because the frames dropped due to assets being loaded into GPU memory which theres nothing you can do about it. If you boil it down yes the CPU is a bottleneck but its more complicated then saying either is a bottleneck. For reference at how complicated it is when I play NMS my CPU frame times regularly above 30 ms which if it works as described should put me into missing dropped or late frame territory making the game unplayable and yet Im typically in either reprojected or on time frames making it so I see green or yellow frames. This is because a variety of factors other than just the CPU go into a frame being made. VR is typically GPU bound and if the CPU is late but the frames ready from the GPU SteamVR may just push it out either way because well its a rendered frame so why not use it. Also your in a laptop which is thermally constrained meaning at a best case senerio youll get maybe 5% more performance for days and weeks of headaches along with general instability and probably more dropped frames. The simple answer is that you are most likely not experiencing a CPU bottleneck if you are dropping frames but more likely a setting is set wrong and needs to be changed. Your CPU frame time is fine.','i4tjj7p','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4toa09/'

Not many VR players want rough looking games. After Alyx everything is looking like trash right now so its not a good time to go light on the art style. The whole grid texture and lack of any detail just makes this look bland and that makes me think its gonan be boring. Also can you move around or are you locked in one spot the whole time? Because if theres no locomotion Im uninterested. Those games were fun in 2016/2017 but I hate feeling trapped in one spot personally.    Honestly Id suggest these changes: ditching the grid texture on everything - it screams unfinished demo and makes the colours pop a lot less. Sometimes less is more. Ditch the random buildings (the skycraper looks horribly scaled... maybe if it were at the back??) spread randomly and ditch the roof -its ON a rainbow isnt it? Not in?   The main change Id make is to have the level start devoid of colour and instead of random unity assets like palm trees and skyscrapers have blank white or grey walls (no grid!) pop up randomly around you. As you shoot zombies they splat different colours on the walls. Once a wall is completely coloured it folds down onto the ground and becomes that ground piece. Game is won when 360degrees around you is turned like someone played a rainbow paintball game. So instead of having random looking lazily coloured/textured assets for your zombies cover you have a bunch of canvasses to paint with what looks like the coolest part of your game - the splat fx.   Bonus idea: instead of a roof have an open sky but with mini podiums hovering around you that fill up with dead zombies spectating you.   [Heres an old wii game that I think you should borrow some ideas from. Notice how the colours pop more with simple shapes and no grid texture??](https://www.google.com/search?q=de+blob+game&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU912AU912&oq=de+blob+game&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l3j69i60l2j69i65j69i60.2304j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)','i4u4b3h','/r/SteamVR/comments/u453i8/be_among_the_first_few_to_try_the_demo_sign_up_on/i4w3sig/'

Maybe even getting into reprojection but that should be too bad. Also overclocking probably wont do much since youll be constrained thermally from the laptop form factor. I guess I should also be asking but whats your GPU? That should matter more in this case. Also what do you mean input lag? And how do you know its 10 or 12 ms? Is that the frame time because if that is and frames arnt dropping or you are not into late frame territory (Which sounds like you may at worse be in reprojection) then its frankly not something to worry about.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4tj722/'

'i4toa09','2022-04-15 05:26:59','sdrft1','u42eyf','Why does my cpu keep on getting input lag?','If you are experiencing frame drops its not your CPU. A frame drop has many ways it occurs but the most common is a frame is rendered far to late for even a late frame timing and has to be dropped so the compositor can move onto the next frame. A drop is a serious event usually seen as a pink spike. If your seeing the occasional frame drop this is just like stuttering you would experience in a 2d game when assets are loaded into the GPU memory and during this thats why it has to drop the frame. Your 12/13 ms frame time is no where close to even a late frame being rendered but a reprojected frame. In order for a late frame the frame time of the pipeline must be at 40 fps rendered 25 ms or more almost double what you have. And in order for a frame to be dropped the frame must be rendered so late (typically 40 or more ms) that the headsets moved to far for reprojection to solve it and the frame must be dropped so the system can move onto the next frame. What you are describing either sounds like constant (As in about 25% or more of the frames are dropped) dropped frames in which case you need to update to the latest SteamVR beta 1.22.5 and turn oiff hardware accelerated Gpu scheduling or intermittent (Once every could of seconds or minutes) which point to either needing to use DDU to reinstall the latest Nvidia driver or theres nothing you can do about it because the frames dropped due to assets being loaded into GPU memory which theres nothing you can do about it. If you boil it down yes the CPU is a bottleneck but its more complicated then saying either is a bottleneck. For reference at how complicated it is when I play NMS my CPU frame times regularly above 30 ms which if it works as described should put me into missing dropped or late frame territory making the game unplayable and yet Im typically in either reprojected or on time frames making it so I see green or yellow frames. This is because a variety of factors other than just the CPU go into a frame being made. VR is typically GPU bound and if the CPU is late but the frames ready from the GPU SteamVR may just push it out either way because well its a rendered frame so why not use it. Also your in a laptop which is thermally constrained meaning at a best case senerio youll get maybe 5% more performance for days and weeks of headaches along with general instability and probably more dropped frames. The simple answer is that you are most likely not experiencing a CPU bottleneck if you are dropping frames but more likely a setting is set wrong and needs to be changed. Your CPU frame time is fine.','i4tjj7p','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4toa09/'

It was probably the Complementary shaders I had turned on but it was not only basically unplayably slow but it seemed to be slowing down my whole PC.  I should have tried running it without any applications going in the background but those didnt cause issue with other VR applications normally.  Ill try it again without shaders and a lot of programs running in the background but I have a feeling disabling HAGS will be the thing that gets Vivecraft running smoothly.','i4snjav','/r/SteamVR/comments/u3wfwa/steamvr_hates_the_lab_and_refuses_to_launch_it/i4u5n5c/'

Maybe even getting into reprojection but that should be too bad. Also overclocking probably wont do much since youll be constrained thermally from the laptop form factor. I guess I should also be asking but whats your GPU? That should matter more in this case. Also what do you mean input lag? And how do you know its 10 or 12 ms? Is that the frame time because if that is and frames arnt dropping or you are not into late frame territory (Which sounds like you may at worse be in reprojection) then its frankly not something to worry about.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4tj722/'

'i4toa09','2022-04-15 05:26:59','sdrft1','u42eyf','Why does my cpu keep on getting input lag?','If you are experiencing frame drops its not your CPU. A frame drop has many ways it occurs but the most common is a frame is rendered far to late for even a late frame timing and has to be dropped so the compositor can move onto the next frame. A drop is a serious event usually seen as a pink spike. If your seeing the occasional frame drop this is just like stuttering you would experience in a 2d game when assets are loaded into the GPU memory and during this thats why it has to drop the frame. Your 12/13 ms frame time is no where close to even a late frame being rendered but a reprojected frame. In order for a late frame the frame time of the pipeline must be at 40 fps rendered 25 ms or more almost double what you have. And in order for a frame to be dropped the frame must be rendered so late (typically 40 or more ms) that the headsets moved to far for reprojection to solve it and the frame must be dropped so the system can move onto the next frame. What you are describing either sounds like constant (As in about 25% or more of the frames are dropped) dropped frames in which case you need to update to the latest SteamVR beta 1.22.5 and turn oiff hardware accelerated Gpu scheduling or intermittent (Once every could of seconds or minutes) which point to either needing to use DDU to reinstall the latest Nvidia driver or theres nothing you can do about it because the frames dropped due to assets being loaded into GPU memory which theres nothing you can do about it. If you boil it down yes the CPU is a bottleneck but its more complicated then saying either is a bottleneck. For reference at how complicated it is when I play NMS my CPU frame times regularly above 30 ms which if it works as described should put me into missing dropped or late frame territory making the game unplayable and yet Im typically in either reprojected or on time frames making it so I see green or yellow frames. This is because a variety of factors other than just the CPU go into a frame being made. VR is typically GPU bound and if the CPU is late but the frames ready from the GPU SteamVR may just push it out either way because well its a rendered frame so why not use it. Also your in a laptop which is thermally constrained meaning at a best case senerio youll get maybe 5% more performance for days and weeks of headaches along with general instability and probably more dropped frames. The simple answer is that you are most likely not experiencing a CPU bottleneck if you are dropping frames but more likely a setting is set wrong and needs to be changed. Your CPU frame time is fine.','i4tjj7p','/r/SteamVR/comments/u42eyf/why_does_my_cpu_keep_on_getting_input_lag/i4toa09/'

That could basically be the Microsoft Metaverse if they cared enough to build it and it shouldnt even be *that* difficult just add some BigScreen-like video streaming to it so that other people can see your 2D apps.  As for games I am pretty disillusioned in that area. Not just because AAA games are still far away (maybe some PSVR2 ports) but also because I dont like the state of AAA titles in the first place. For the last 10 years or so nothing interesting has happened in that space just more level-up mechanics micro-payments endless sequels and other stuff I consider more filler than game.

You can move around the basket in your roomscale space.   In the centre of the basket is a machine that you use to make bombs that you drop on enemies and fortifications to earn points and upgrades. There is also a mounted gun on two sides of the balloon basket to shoot at airborne enemies.   The centre of the basket also contains a navigation map where you can chart your course and loop around fortifications to choose your path of attack.   The goal of the game is to upgrade your basket’s armour and weapons and survive long enough to reach an area where you enter a storm/portal that takes you forward in time where you will continually encounter newer more advanced enemies and fortifications.   There will also be bosses that can engage you in the air.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u4s10g/what_is_your_dream_vr_game_experience_that_you/i4xvug0/'

This mode does not reduce the noise.  You can change the pitch of whirring noise by changing the channel which they use. Maybe this could help also.

That said the Pico can apparently quite easily compete with the HP Reverb G2 as well. The Pico 3 Link is the same headset Pico has been selling as the Pico 3 Pro and there have been comparos made of the HP and the Pico and over DisplayPort the Pico is a direct competitor. Sure the HP has a few more pixels but 2160 or 1920 is still quite similar.  See https://skarredghost.com/2021/10/09/pico-neo-3-pro-displayport-review/ for instance. There are also through-the-lenses videos on Youtube.  So this more or less replaces a HP Reverb G2 *and* it replaces the Oculus Quest 2 for standalone... sort of. The lack of exclusive games and the lower amount of games for it in general means you get better hardware for the same money but worse software.  Since Im after the PCVR experience almost exclusively getting HP Reverb G2 level performance for a couple hundred less seems like a great deal to me. The standalone stuff is a bonus that may or may not be worth something to me.','i4ur0y4','/r/SteamVR/comments/u2shko/pico_entering_western_market_with_neo_3poised_as/i4xy35g/'

They only support Nvidia and Im on Radeon otherwise I might have gotten that set. With a 3080 you have an ideal PC for it it requires big power.  Theyre hard to set up fiddly to live with and dialing in the IPD and the internal screen setup/offset of the Pimax is crucial to minimize eyestrain (MRTV did a video not too long ago about the process) - but you get that incredible 180 degree FOV.   The upcoming Pimax 12K will probably be pretty spectactular and if you buy an 8KX now they give you the price of the 8KX back if you trade it in for a 12K later.  https://pimax.com/about-pimax-12k-qled-trade-in-program-fully-details/','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u3m957/worth_to_upgrade_or_wait/i4xzl86/'

Nominally no sound device appears in devmgmt.msc under Audio inputs and outputs for the Index.  2. After starting SteamVR despite the headset being selected as the audio device in steamvr -> Audio sound actually comes out of the PC speakers  3. If (after starting steamvr) I go into devmgmt.msc and click on audio devices then click on the icon for Scan for hardware changes it immediately finds a Index HMD (NVIDIA High Definition Audio) and the audio output now goes to the index (assuming steamvr audio output says headset).   This driver has a provider of Microsoft dated 06/12/2019 Version 10.0.19041.1 and is defined in audioendpoint.inf  4. After closing steamvr the Index sound device disappears again.  This is completely reproducible after a clean install of windows 10 21H2 (19044). Seems like a bug where the addition of the Index HMD audio driver doesnt complete properly.  What this means is that **every time I start steamvr I have to go into device manager and hit scan in order for sound to work on the headset**.     Hope this helps others who have been messing around with reinstalling drivers etc','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5ahka/partial_fix_for_index_sound_device_minssing_sound/i50qlog/'

That could basically be the Microsoft Metaverse if they cared enough to build it and it shouldnt even be *that* difficult just add some BigScreen-like video streaming to it so that other people can see your 2D apps.  As for games I am pretty disillusioned in that area. Not just because AAA games are still far away (maybe some PSVR2 ports) but also because I dont like the state of AAA titles in the first place. For the last 10 years or so nothing interesting has happened in that space just more level-up mechanics micro-payments endless sequels and other stuff I consider more filler than game. Last 2D game that impressed me was probably Mirrors Edge and thats a vintage classic at this point in time.

Normaly they turn off almost instantly (well almost) after closing the SteamVR Window. I believe there are 2 Standby Modes the first one keeps thems spinning and only shuts the laser off. This mode does not reduce the noise.  You can change the pitch of whirring noise by changing the channel which they use. Maybe this could help also.  The Flat Front V1 Lighthouses (which where also made by Valve but sold by HTC) are known to be a bit less loud but the difference is minor.','i4xtd2p','/r/SteamVR/comments/u4iyfs/hate_steam_base_stations_help_3/i4xwwsl/'

That said the Pico can apparently quite easily compete with the HP Reverb G2 as well. The Pico 3 Link is the same headset Pico has been selling as the Pico 3 Pro and there have been comparos made of the HP and the Pico and over DisplayPort the Pico is a direct competitor. Sure the HP has a few more pixels but 2160 or 1920 is still quite similar.  See https://skarredghost.com/2021/10/09/pico-neo-3-pro-displayport-review/ for instance. There are also through-the-lenses videos on Youtube.  So this more or less replaces a HP Reverb G2 *and* it replaces the Oculus Quest 2 for standalone... sort of. The lack of exclusive games and the lower amount of games for it in general means you get better hardware for the same money but worse software.  Since Im after the PCVR experience almost exclusively getting HP Reverb G2 level performance for a couple hundred less seems like a great deal to me. The standalone stuff is a bonus that may or may not be worth something to me.','i4ur0y4','/r/SteamVR/comments/u2shko/pico_entering_western_market_with_neo_3poised_as/i4xy35g/'

Its also usable as a PC VR headset directly. All the specs on it are kind of insane and to get max out of it I suspect you need one hell of a PC rig - but it also has an XR2 chipset in it and can work standalone.

They only support Nvidia and Im on Radeon otherwise I might have gotten that set. With a 3080 you have an ideal PC for it it requires big power.  Theyre hard to set up fiddly to live with and dialing in the IPD and the internal screen setup/offset of the Pimax is crucial to minimize eyestrain (MRTV did a video not too long ago about the process) - but you get that incredible 180 degree FOV.   The upcoming Pimax 12K will probably be pretty spectactular and if you buy an 8KX now they give you the price of the 8KX back if you trade it in for a 12K later.  https://pimax.com/about-pimax-12k-qled-trade-in-program-fully-details/','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u3m957/worth_to_upgrade_or_wait/i4xzl86/'

Nominally no sound device appears in devmgmt.msc under Audio inputs and outputs for the Index.  2. After starting SteamVR despite the headset being selected as the audio device in steamvr -> Audio sound actually comes out of the PC speakers  3. If (after starting steamvr) I go into devmgmt.msc and click on audio devices then click on the icon for Scan for hardware changes it immediately finds a Index HMD (NVIDIA High Definition Audio) and the audio output now goes to the index (assuming steamvr audio output says headset).   This driver has a provider of Microsoft dated 06/12/2019 Version 10.0.19041.1 and is defined in audioendpoint.inf  4. After closing steamvr the Index sound device disappears again.  This is completely reproducible after a clean install of windows 10 21H2 (19044). Seems like a bug where the addition of the Index HMD audio driver doesnt complete properly.  What this means is that **every time I start steamvr I have to go into device manager and hit scan in order for sound to work on the headset**.     Hope this helps others who have been messing around with reinstalling drivers etc','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5ahka/partial_fix_for_index_sound_device_minssing_sound/i50qlog/'

Nominally no sound device appears in devmgmt.msc under Audio inputs and outputs for the Index.  2. After starting SteamVR despite the headset being selected as the audio device in steamvr -> Audio sound actually comes out of the PC speakers  3. If (after starting steamvr) I go into devmgmt.msc and click on audio devices then click on the icon for Scan for hardware changes it immediately finds a Index HMD (NVIDIA High Definition Audio) and the audio output now goes to the index (assuming steamvr audio output says headset).   This driver has a provider of Microsoft dated 06/12/2019 Version 10.0.19041.1 and is defined in audioendpoint.inf  4. After closing steamvr the Index sound device disappears again.  This is completely reproducible after a clean install of windows 10 21H2 (19044). Seems like a bug where the addition of the Index HMD audio driver doesnt complete properly.  What this means is that **every time I start steamvr I have to go into device manager and hit scan in order for sound to work on the headset**.     Hope this helps others who have been messing around with reinstalling drivers etc','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5ahka/partial_fix_for_index_sound_device_minssing_sound/i50qlog/'

Stationary wave based shooters arent interesting for PCVR in 2022. It could probably work in standalone oculus/pico but not PCVR. It has to be something more. Youre competing with alyx boneworks AAA ports AAA mods to work in VR (GTA5 Outer Wilds etc) great narrative experiences (wanderer fishermans tale etc) social apps (vr chat rec room the under presents.. etc) combat sand boxes (pavlov blade and sorcery).

The sale goes away in a few hrs and I’m rushing to find out if they would work at all with a future purchase of an oculus so thanks for ur help. So with steam VR how does the headset and audio sync if it isn’t directly connected to the oculus?

Latency all that should be identical at the source.      Just pretend you are using it to play normal games. Its the exact same process windows just ignores the VR headsets audio sources and pipes it into the thing you told it to. Right is always right left is always left.      Youre good fam.

We can only hope altough what I have noticed for myself (and again YMMV) is a baffling lack of compatibility between new GPU hardware and VR almost like they just dont care anymore. Have you checked recently some of the AMD and/or NVIDIA forums?   Issues are VERY common and widespread. Not to mention the  disaster that Windows 11 is... So either the GPU companies up their game with drivers OR Valve does something on their softwares side... Otherwise we will eventually end up with just a handful of (possibily outdated) configs actually working properly with VR. And this maddens me.','i57q2ri','/r/SteamVR/comments/u68tpn/big_changes_are_coming_to_steam_vr/i57skbo/'

The sale goes away in a few hrs and I’m rushing to find out if they would work at all with a future purchase of an oculus so thanks for ur help. So with steam VR how does the headset and audio sync if it isn’t directly connected to the oculus?

Latency all that should be identical at the source.  Just pretend you are using it to play normal games. Its the exact same process windows just ignores the VR headsets audio sources and pipes it into the thing you told it to. Right is always right left is always left.  Youre good fam.

We can only hope altough what I have noticed for myself (and again YMMV) is a baffling lack of compatibility between new GPU hardware and VR almost like they just dont care anymore. Have you checked recently some of the AMD and/or NVIDIA forums?   Issues are VERY common and widespread. Not to mention the  disaster that Windows 11 is... So either the GPU companies up their game with drivers OR Valve does something on their softwares side... Otherwise we will eventually end up with just a handful of (possibily outdated) configs actually working properly with VR.

If you are searching the universe for VR Guro content - I think thats what the developers were warning about but oddly I cant find references to those things referenced in the reviews on Steam.  Nobody mentioned and then they put their <blank> in the severed <blank>  So Im guessing this is a bit of false advertising and this stuff only exists in 2D art like oil paintings and book pages. The same stuff youd find in a real-world museum. Ergo Steam not having a problem with it.

I have experience as a game dev myself and I think you are on a great path.   Learning from Youtube is fine honestly.  Now not to come in here and shit up your plans but have you looked at Unreal Engine 4 ? its very similar to Unity and its really whatever between the 2.  I say this because as far as game dev goes why reinvent the wheel? what I mean to say is if you would use a texture or object in a game to save you creating them how far does that stretch?  Making Modded Maps for instance for Pavlov VR seems reasonably approachable and could be an easy toe dip to familiarise yourself with the basics without undertaking anything too difficult. break down what works cannibalise it to understand it and continue from there.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5oulf/learning_unity_for_a_school_project_need_to_clear/i5bd347/'

Obviously this will not be an official answer anymore but FYI even if sharing a Ragnaröck runes map is legal most of the times the audio file is also attached to it and this is not legal. The studio has always officially licensed the songs first because its mandatory and second because we/they believe the artists (awesome) work deserves payment.  The only legal solution would be to use a music streaming platform api (spotify etc.) as the audio source and share only the rune maps but that would probably require the user to have a premium account and it would be tricky to implement correctly from a technical standpoint.  Anyway thanks for the love Ive put a lot of effort into making this game great and I have friends at Wanadev Studio who still do <3','hz6of4l','/r/SteamVR/comments/kewhn7/ragnaröck_is_out_m_viking_metal_rythm_game/i5bhubp/'

If you are searching the universe for VR Guro content - I think thats what the developers were warning about but oddly I cant find references to those things referenced in the reviews on Steam.  Nobody mentioned and then they put their <blank> in the severed <blank>  So Im guessing this is a bit of false advertising and this stuff only exists in 2D art like oil paintings and book pages. The same stuff youd find in a real-world museum. Ergo Steam not having a problem with it.

I have experience as a game dev myself and I think you are on a great path.   Learning from Youtube is fine honestly.  Now not to come in here and shit up your plans but have you looked at Unreal Engine 4 ? its very similar to Unity and its really whatever between the 2.  I say this because as far as game dev goes why reinvent the wheel? what I mean to say is if you would use a texture or object in a game to save you creating them how far does that stretch?  Making Modded Maps for instance for Pavlov VR seems reasonably approachable and could be an easy toe dip to familiarise yourself with the basics without undertaking anything too difficult. break down what works cannibalise it to understand it and continue from there.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5oulf/learning_unity_for_a_school_project_need_to_clear/i5bd347/'

Obviously this will not be an official answer anymore but FYI even if sharing a Ragnaröck runes map is legal most of the times the audio file is also attached to it and this is not legal. The studio has always officially licensed the songs first because its mandatory and second because we/they believe the artists (awesome) work deserves payment.  The only legal solution would be to use a music streaming platform api (spotify etc.) as the audio source and share only the rune maps but that would probably require the user to have a premium account and it would be tricky to implement correctly from a technical standpoint.

I have experience as a game dev myself and I think you are on a great path.   Learning from Youtube is fine honestly.  Now not to come in here and shit up your plans but have you looked at Unreal Engine 4 ? its very similar to Unity and its really whatever between the 2.  I say this because as far as game dev goes why reinvent the wheel? what I mean to say is if you would use a texture or object in a game to save you creating them how far does that stretch?  Making Modded Maps for instance for Pavlov VR seems reasonably approachable and could be an easy toe dip to familiarise yourself with the basics without undertaking anything too difficult. break down what works cannibalise it to understand it and continue from there.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u5oulf/learning_unity_for_a_school_project_need_to_clear/i5bd347/'

Obviously this will not be an official answer anymore but FYI even if sharing a Ragnaröck runes map is legal most of the times the audio file is also attached to it and this is not legal. The studio has always officially licensed the songs first because its mandatory and second because we/they believe the artists (awesome) work deserves payment.  The only legal solution would be to use a music streaming platform api (spotify etc.) as the audio source and share only the rune maps but that would probably require the user to have a premium account and it would be tricky to implement correctly from a technical standpoint.

Im not sure if youre accounting for that yet but it would be nice to give it a look at this thread from Paper Fire Rookie: https://steamcommunity.com/app/698790/discussions/0/1744479063996367203/ I cant promise Ill jump in to try the current release and report back anytime soon as Im currently healing some injuries after falling from my skateboard but as soon as Im better Ill give it a try. Im just pointing this out to you as your game is primarily about throwing stuff hahaha so without a good throwing feeling it would be completely ruined for WMR folks. Im glad to know the mappings is on your roade map! Ven VR Adventures totally gave up on that and posted a half assed tutorial on how to do it and TBH made pretty much all of us give up on it and consider it without WMR support at all.

Its actually a touch heavier than the 8k X (with the battery but it always needs a battery so...).   I guess its a trade off. You cant really make a wide FOV without significantly increasing the size of the headset. Maybe the lighter lenses will let headsets have a wider fov in the next-next-gen headsets but it seems no one tried yet.  It also seems that only Pimax (mostly in the 12k) and Varjo pushed for higher clarity too with only a few of the next-gen even pushing up to 4k per eye.  I guess it depends on what people found bothersome in current-gen like we all hated the cables so those are going away at least. Ive got a thick neck so the weight of the 8k X never bothered me but Ive read people who found the relatively light Quest 2 a burden -- those people will likely be in for a treat with the pancake lenses being so much lighter.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u7n2lv/helmet_fov_ranking_current_vision_fov_tested_in/i5g3llt/'

I hope it helps you guys :) Theres some folks who own a WMR alongside a Quest maybe if you could find some of those willing to test and report it could help even more. Most of the throwing tuned for the Vive ends up with us hitting our feets in WMR and the amount of force we have to put been waaaaaaaay beyond it should dunno if it matches with the report youve got so far. It usually works fine for throwing stuff in a upwards movement from bottom to up or crossways like a frisbee but throwing stuff baseball or basketball style is usually a mess. Idk if youre using physics but just remembered that the Vertigo Remastered dev had previously tied it to the framerate and it caused issues for Quest users playing on Steam cause their HMDs run at lower framerate and it made the weapons heavier/slower.

I doubt they would leave out finger tracking from their promotional material and their spec sheets if it actually had finger tracking.

With fov mod it improves the fov better than Q2 Q1 maybe CV1  but also improve the edge to edge clarity...   But the controlers was meh... I was craving the knuckles.. . So I use a mixed vr setup to have the best hmd with the best controlers..   But a mixed vr setup also mean a lot of time wasted to make everything works and compatibility issues so I tried some high end hmd to get rid of the mixed vr stuff and have a full lighthouse tracked setup. Tried the vp2 tried the 8kx but always come back to my g2 :)...   Maybe if Im crazy enough Ill sell a kidney to try a varjo aero...

The only kits youll find with outside-in tracking are the original Rift and the PSVR. Its important to remember that your lighthouses dont do anything but flood the room with IR while laser emitters sweep the room theyre not tracking anything your headset is doing all of that.      This is a common misconception which is totally understandable as people always talk about inside-out tracking in relation to things like the quest and a lot of people then make the leap that the difference is the lighthouses and assume other kits must instead be outside-in.','i5inv36','/r/SteamVR/comments/u7xro7/freaking_collector/i5ixys2/'

It starts with a reference to a previous piece. Never do this in a periodical.  People are not going to be familiar with your previous piece and even if they read it arent going to remember the significant content.      2. You are using a lot of loan words vernacular context and terminology often to restate things unnecessarily.  That adds length without meaning and its confusing to read.       3. The table of contents is unnecessary overly granular  and somehow still missing the information that might redeem it because everything truncates with ellipses before providing useful information.      4. Theres a ton of conclusion without explanation and statements of the obvious. Most of what you say isnt clearly making an evaluation. That means it reads less like a review and more like an advertisement.           5. The for me/not for me segment is in completely the wrong place in terms of the flow of the article before any of the information to support it... And heres some foreshadowing it also doesnt present a useful conclusion or any meaningful information beyond the author liked this game. Which youve already said repeatedly 5 or 6 times by this point in the page *still without really telling us why.*      **At this point youve already lost most readers they know you like it but they dont trust your opinion because you havent given them a valid thesis you havent made an effort to engage and you havent offered anything to back up your opinion.**      6. The next several sections are just you describing the process of playing the game without actually evaluating any of it in a way that might be meaningful to a potential reader.  The text is self involved and overly florid - fine in some contexts (first person narrative reddit posts etc.) but a waste of text in the case of a technical or critical analysis.         7. You do finally add some critique by finding a few things to *kind of*  complain about but they feel perfunctory and disingenuous there as a matter of course so that you can say its a review.   The problem is that theres not much real evaluation or comparison going on throughout the article it takes up a ton of space but provides relatively little information.      8. Then to put the cherry on top you put affiliate links at the bottom discarding any and all credibility and telling us that we absolutely for sure shouldnt *completely* trust any positive recommendations you make regarding anything.         9. Its just too damned long for the amount of information it contains.   Long form reviews work because they contain detailed evaluation and analysis that isnt practical in shorter formats this has all the size with none of the detail.','i5iveej','/r/SteamVR/comments/u72tql/townsmen_vr_review_a_grandiose_plea_for_virtual/i5j2bbu/'

I have tried 3 different laptops to run VR (1 of my own and 2 others from people I know) and the result was ALWAYS the same.  The GPU would run so hot that it would end up thermal throttling which would cripple my framerate making VR unplayable.  I ended up building an i9-12900k workstation with an EVGA 3080Ti FTW3.  MUCH BETTER VR experience!  Laptops are great for portability but not meant for VR.  You will get 30mins of great VR portability (if you can actually hear over the blast from the fans running at 100%) and then your framerate will drop considerably because your GPU will hit the thermal threshold.  This is just my experience (with a VERY similar ASUS laptop).  Take it for what it is worth.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u84g22/is_this_good_enough_for_vr_it_has_rtx_3080_ryzen/i5jesyv/'

I hope it helps you guys :) Theres some folks who own a WMR alongside a Quest maybe if you could find some of those willing to test and report it could help even more. Most of the throwing tuned for the Vive ends up with us hitting our feets in WMR and the amount of force we have to put been waaaaaaaay beyond it should dunno if it matches with the report youve got so far. It usually works fine for throwing stuff in a upwards movement from bottom to up or crossways like a frisbee but throwing stuff baseball or basketball style is usually a mess. Idk if youre using physics but just remembered that the Vertigo Remastered dev had previously tied it to the framerate and it caused issues for Quest users playing on Steam cause their HMDs run at lower framerate and it made the weapons heavier/slower.

I doubt they would leave out finger tracking from their promotional material and their spec sheets if it actually had finger tracking.

With fov mod it improves the fov better than Q2 Q1 maybe CV1  but also improve the edge to edge clarity...   But the controlers was meh... I was craving the knuckles.. . So I use a mixed vr setup to have the best hmd with the best controlers..   But a mixed vr setup also mean a lot of time wasted to make everything works and compatibility issues so I tried some high end hmd to get rid of the mixed vr stuff and have a full lighthouse tracked setup. Tried the vp2 tried the 8kx but always come back to my g2 :)...   Maybe if Im crazy enough Ill sell a kidney to try a varjo aero...

This is a common misconception which is totally understandable as people always talk about inside-out tracking in relation to things like the quest and a lot of people then make the leap that the difference is the lighthouses and assume other kits must instead be outside-in.','i5inv36','/r/SteamVR/comments/u7xro7/freaking_collector/i5ixys2/'

With a lot left to explore especially in the area of filmmaking. Felix & Paul do great stuff as do some others. But a lot of early work appears to have become lost media since the demise of Jaunt and some of its predecessors (Within is the sole survivor and Im glad stuff like LovR and The Evolution of Verse is preserved there). Of course theres still good old Henry which is ideal for children who want to try VR since its meant to be viewed sitting on the floor.   Among stuff I believe to be lost: A science fiction short starring Joel Hodgson where youre an alien being mocked by the crew the sublime Ghost in the Shell: Virtual Reality Diver (Not to be confused with the later GitS video) a great short set in Disneyland that ended with the Be Our Guest parade and worst of all Invisible which was an entire VR series that showed off how standard film techniques could be perfectly adapted to VR (even jump cuts).  Hopefully these short VR films will one day be rediscovered and preserved again for ~~me~~ all to enjoy.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u8pw6h/what_are_3_words_you_would_use_to_describe_your/i5o3jm3/'

The standard index    controllers are so thin that my hands cramp up a lot when using them and    having an extra slope in the palm makes it a lot more comfortable. I    made the cheekrest shorter to accomodate a wide range of gunshapes so if    a certain weapon has lower sights you can just lean your head in more    to get a proper sight picture. it works with all different types of    weapons without interference. Im able to use shotguns snipers    pistols smgs Rocket launchers and they all work beautifully in game.Obviously    there is now a physical object that you have to slightly manuver around    but I tried to keep the design as low profile and minimalist as    possible to help avoid accidental bumps or collisions and honestly Im    amazed with how much it DOESNT get in the way.If you want a little    extra insurance against bumps and to make the whole thing operate    smoothly you can wrap some parts in gauze tape or get small foam    adhesive strips to padd areas that you MIGHT bump with your off hand.    Especially covering the front grip in foam makes it SUPER smooth and    quick to operate.','-','/r/SteamVR/comments/u99e0m/just_finished_prototyping_a_stock_for_the_valve/i5qb43v/'

The downside is that controllers are a little bit toy like compared to other models but for me they are doing the job.  The good thing with G2 is that you dont need base stations for tracking. Headsets like Valve Index have great controllers but you need to install base stations in your room to track your movement since controllers alone cant do that.  Also theres a chance that you will just get bored with VR after couple of months so investing a fortune in a super advanced headset may be a miss.','i5qyrqr','/r/SteamVR/comments/u968vv/can_this_build_run_vr_well/i5r0vdl/'

Do they come with the headsets that use them or are they bought seperatly?  Check Valve Index on Steam. You can but the whole set (head display controllers and base stations) or each part separately (but those are usually out of stock).
