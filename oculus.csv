If you set oculus to around x2000 and 80hz but leave SS to 150 pct it will raise resolution to x3000 which is way too high. Alyx uses dynamic resolution but there is only so much it can do.

Agree?','Possible but not necessarily.  Problem with VR for me at least is that hardware is getting better but software continues to be trash. And theres no time limit on when software will not be trash.  Oculuss flagship game release of last year was a port of a Gamecube game from 2004. Were not going to hit the Promised Land with remakes and reboots from 20 years ago.   Valve released Alyx which was pretty great albeit very short and linear. And thats it. Its been years since it came out and they havent done anything else.   And so on. At this pace VR might never hit it big if all we keep getting is shitty ports and shovelware and maybe an occasional gem once every 2-5 years. Its not going to cut it.  However we might get lucky. What VR needs is a social event similar to what WoW did for MMO genre. Before WoW biggest MMO had \~275k subscribers. And that was seen as a success. WoW was projected to get \`\~500k subscribers and it was seen as optimistic. But Blizzard hit it out of the park and it went into millions. Well within 5 years of WoWs launch MMOs began to hit 1+ million users at launch fairly often. Which would have been unheard of pre-WoW.   And this is what VR needs - a WoW-like game that is so good that it will make people go out and buy VR headsets exclusively for that game. Just like back in 04-05 it wasnt uncommon to have someone walk into a store and ask if this PC will run WoW because thats all they wanted it for.   If that happens VR has a solid chance. But if they continue with the shitty ports or short and shallow shovelware the tech is not going anywhere. When Sony announces a new Playstation they also announce a ton of amazing games to go with it. They dont just release a new Playstation with some ports from the 1980s. When Nintendo released Switch they didnt just release it with some games from the 90s they released it with Breath of the Wild which was near peak of its class. Since then Switch got amazing games ported like Witcher 3 Dying Light Divinity 2 etc. But when Oculus released Quest 2 what did they release it with? A bunch of weak short shallow shovelware that nobody was talking about even a week later because theres nothing to talk about no content no substance. And ports so far (or announced) are from 2004 and 2005. This is not going to fly.  Thats the scary part. This tech can still fizzle out and die. Without content or strong reasons to use it theres no reason to buy the hardware.','-','/r/oculus/comments/tvh91q/alvin_wang_htc_china_ceo_posted_this_pic_of_vrxrs/i39e17m/'

Theres a reason Meta spent only 5 minutes of their hour long Connect conference talking about gaming VR/AR is already moving beyond that.  Sure having some big AAA titles each year can only help but I have more non-gaming friends with a Quest than gaming friends with a Quest.  Apple is going to get into the AR/VR world in a big way and probably wont have many games Vive seems content to move away from gaming headsets and now Meta is focusing on bigger things.  These headsets are revolutionizing many industries including Fitness media consumption productivity training social etc.  Gaming will continue to be a big part of this but its not right to crap all over the current content sure RE4 is a port of a 20 year old game but it doesnt matter it sells headsets.  And these smaller games may not meet your expectations but theyre attractive to a lot of mainstream users.  Switch only has a few big games each year and a pile of shovelware.  Meta needs to do better but its not far off what the others are doing.  This graph is pretty accurate its going to take a few more years to really take off but once some other big players get in the game it will be pretty unstoppable.','i39e17m','/r/oculus/comments/tvh91q/alvin_wang_htc_china_ceo_posted_this_pic_of_vrxrs/i39klf4/'

If its floating up in the air you can use one of the controllers to touch your physical floor to adjust. Or just use thumbsticks.  Some games might still have problems if they are designed just for a very tall character. Thats where Adjust Height setting in Accessibility tab (previously in experimental features) can be toggled to give you some extra height in such games.','-','/r/oculus/comments/tvahch/guys_why_is_my_height_so_broken_in_games/i39ocj7/'

Personally I’m on Team BOBOVR M2 Pro all the way. In my experience the halo straps take the pressure off the face and are so much more comfortable the the regular “squeeze the melon” straps. Also the fact that the M2 Pro has an integrated battery pack means I get more play time. I absolutely love mine and would recommend it to anyone. Just got to take the time when you initially set it up to configure and adjust it to your head. Some people complain about the top pads but I really like them and the stability they provide. If you’re worried you may not like it buy it on Amazon so you can return it easily. If you don’t want/need the battery pack then the M2 (non Pro) is also a really good option.

Facebook is very conscious of the fact that they are notorious for spying on their users and we all know full well that theyre already integrating the same invasive analytics into their VR products. They just dont want to remind people of this fact every time they boot up their headsets by greeting them with what is essentially a giant floating eyeball in a black void. The [Original Oculus Logo](https://www.logodesignlove.com/images/logos/old-oculus-logo.jpg) was even less subtle and they ditched that almost immediately after they acquired the company from Palmer.  Personally though Ill never accept the name and logo change. Im already stocking up on Oculus branded stickers to slap on future headsets and if I have to replace my current quest 2 anytime soon Ill probably remove the front plate from the broken headset and pop it onto the new one.

You cant run a Windows PCVR game natively on an Android Quest as theyre different operating systems with wildly different specifications.  There is the PCVR store (Rift). There is the Quest store. Some games will appear on both as the developers have made two versions one for Windows and one for Android. Some games will even give you the PC version free if you buy the Quest one from the Oculus store (and vice versa) - this is called cross buy.

The apps you play with Link / Airlink are developed to run on Windows and are technically the same apps that you can play on the Rift / Rift S. As soon as you unplug the Quest 2 from your computer the device switches to standalone mode and is running on the Oculus own operating system. That means that there are other apps running on the Quest 2 on standalone.  A lot of apps are developed for both platforms and some of them support cross-buy that means that you only have to purchase one version and receive both to play with Link and with the Quest 2 in standalone mode.  Here you can find a selection of apps that support cross-buy: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/section/2335732183153590/#/?_k=zv5qsw','-','/r/oculus/comments/u12fop/is_it_possible_to_transfer_games_from_the_oculus/i49pv3b/'

If your laptop does not have a dedicated gpu then you may be limited to less complex games but they should play about the same as they do now using your laptop.  Also for game controls youll need to use the same keyboard/mouse/gamepad as you currently use.   Just dont expect 1080p resolution with the Go.  Itll probably look more like 720p at best.

I am looking to upgrade my entire oculus setup and I was wondering if Kiwi Products are good.','Ive had elite strap delux audio strap 3x different Amazon straps with battery attached bobo vr halo and now the kiwi all even have a cloth strap horizontally to help too.  And honestly Ive just stopped playing the quest 2 at this point I went through this shit with quest 1 and should of known better this time around cant say I havent tried but its just too heavy compared to my cv1 its still uncomfortable after a short while and I always know its there especially in action turning around fast in racket nx for example the headset keeps going when I stop unless I absolutely squash my face to hold it a little better but then I dont want to use it.  Bobo gets alot of hype but its proper jank the way it attaches is poor and can mean its on the piss when you grab it to chuck straight on as it just slides around on the arms while it does take weight off your face it still suffers with the wobble like all halos so fast movements leaves headset smacking into top of my nose fine for sit down stuff but not anything active.  Kiwi is basically the elite strap with a padded back thats it cant say its any worse or better really could do with more weight on the back on it and still needs headset tightened more than a comfortable amount to try hold headset from swinging under fast movements but thats not headstrap to blame just the weight out front on headset itself.  This is just me though while Im perfectly happy with a cloth strap on my oculus go its pointless on quest 2 so anything you put on will be better just doesnt come close to the comfort of my cv1 so I stick to playing on that.  Cant go wrong with kiwi products they always seem to be built well given the cost though you are basically paying for an elite strap that hopefully wont break Ive only had it a few weeks so cant say how itll hold up but then my elite never broke on me.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u10053/is_the_kiwi_strap_good_i_am_looking_to_upgrade_my/i4a0eg3/'

You dont know what ANYBODY is going through you can disagree with people without being a complete asshole. You can simply ignore the post and scroll. And yes I am replying to an old comment. Maybe your mentality has grown up a bit more to be able to  at least receive constructive criticism. You lash out at people and then act like the victim when they defend themselves (like that comment about your name being attacked after being condescending towards another commenter who did nothing). This isnt me attacking you this is me trying to stop you from attacking others. Stop. MANY of us alre have a lot to deal with and have to live our lives one day at a time with pain we didnt ask for.

Originally I bought the [M2 Pro](https://www.bobovr.com/product/m2pro/) and I thought I loved it but I had a really hard time focusing. I really wanted that battery option though so I gambled a bit and bought the [retrofit kit](https://www.bobovr.com/support/bobovr-strap-retrofit-kit/) to essential turn it into the [M1 Pro](https://www.bobovr.com/support/bobovr-m1-pro/) and Im very happy now. Ive never used the Kiwi but if the battery thing isnt important to you Id say stick with that because everyone seems to love it. My M1 Pro though has hot-swappable batteries and is pretty comfy. The battery is heavy enough to just add a little more weight balance too.

Stuff like pimax or apara do exist but aren’t really mass market products imo. All more expensive and usually not wireless.  I wouldn’t say other headset are generally better they are better in certain areas but inferior in others so in the end it’s really hard to justify the heavy price difference.  IMO it doesn’t make any sense to buy another headset even for pcvr right now for 2 reasons. 1. price and 2. content. Looks like many upcoming games will be quest exclusive so you essentially lose on a ton of content when buying another headset + paying more.

Dry fire mags for example sub 100. Last I saw they have a laser system you can put in your AR. Also cool fire trainer is something I recently picked up for my pistol which I can set up a range with my projector in my house so simulate actual fire.  I’m not saying this system is bad but seems to be more efficient and cost effective ways. I’m just curious how it translates.   I’d love to see how your set up actually works and wouldn’t mind trying myself. I’ve always wanted to start a business with actual rifles using either CO2 or something to actuate the action.

Thats what I got into VR for and mainly what I used as an excuse for spending tons of money on games... support game developers so that they will hopefully blow up and make proper AAA games. Alyx remains to be the best VR experience Ive ever had and it doesnt look like those games are even being developed anymore. While I love casual low-fi games thats just not what I envisioned.

We wanted to do a slightly better version as a prototype and went a bit overboard with it:D  Near term:  * More ways to categorize and tag games. * Curated rating for games by trusted people from the community * Work with game developers on customizing their pages * Better UX for browsing like previewing screenshots/videos search * Promoting and running giveaways maybe generating some video content for games (need some way to pay for all of this:))  There is a ton of great games on Applab deserving attention. Connecting and sorting these games into sections and giving players more ways to browse through them will hopefully help developers to reach more players. A lot of great games came and died on applab :/  Future:  I am really keen on creating VR native version of the store. Its something that is really missing in my opinion. I like the idea of using your phone + gaze as input to “scroll” through the environment of games. And somehow represent all the games in 3D + ways to categorize them. Maybe custom launcher I really hate the default library.Will see:)  Sorry for the lengthy response I sort of used it as a way to really think about our priorities.','i4ai92q','/r/oculus/comments/u14a1w/list_of_all_free_demos_available_on_quest_app_lab/i4auc8x/'

Although the shadows and textures are lower quality than I had hoped the devs fit so much into each scene. It has been great fun to roleplay that survival motif. The tension in peering through the dense foliage for threats is greatly contrasted with the sense of relief sitting at the campfire each night roasting food. There are some bugs and balancing that still need done but the game is very solid and ambitious for a Quest release.

Your FPS might make some games unplayable though because low frame rates are directly associated with motion sickness in VR.     The thing about VR is that your GPU is rendering two images one for each eye instead of just a single monitor. Thats why it takes so much more processing power than regular gaming.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u1bhbc/can_my_gtx_1650_run_quest_2_via_link_cable_steam/i4bbkc4/'

The only thing I didnt like is the latency its noticeably more laggy and less crisp even standalone compared to Rift S. If you transition from one to the other back and forth it is noticeable. But as soon as you switch to Quest 2 full time after a few days or a week you stop noticing it.   I also HATED the cable on Rift S. So Quest 2 was worth it on the basis of Air Link alone. Visual clarity was just a bonus.  Also my IPD is 68.5 and Rift S is locked to 63.5 so it was always a little blurry for me. Quest 2 is adjustable and much clearer though unfortunately I see the edges of the screen quite clearly with it.  The only thing is I dont know if the switch is worth it NOW. Back in 2020 it totally was. But I feel like now Quest 2 is past its prime and is closer to the end of its life cycle. I dont expect Quest 3 this year but quite possibly next year. This year well likely see Cambria. At this point maybe waiting for Quest 3 might be better.

'i4bhsp2','2022-04-11 10:27:58','JorgTheElder','u12fop','Is it possible to transfer games from the oculus store to the quest?','There are at least two Oculus Stores. The Quest store and the Rift store are two different things. Just like the Apple iOS store is a different than the Apple OSX store.  **Oculus Cross-Buy a Primer:**  The Quest and Rift *(Quest + Link = Rift)* are two very different platforms and they each have their own stores. If you access the store on the Quest *(without out Link/AirLink/VD)* you are on the Quest store. If you access the store from the PCVR software you are on the Rift store.  If you use the web or mobile app you can choose the store from a list.  Apps that give you support for both platforms for one price/buy are called ***cross-buy*** titles.  Because of the resources required to support both platforms *(and sometimes due to licensing issues)* not all games support cross-buy. If a game does not support cross-buy you have to buy it on both platforms to play it on both platforms.   It is easy to identify a *cross-buy* title. The *Oculus Store* description for an app *should* always show the devices you are buying a license for.  * If it says **both** *Supports Rift* **and** *Supports Quest* in the description it is a *cross-buy* title. * If it lists only a single platform you are only buying a license for that single platform.

I used to run ALVR and VD with the Oculus Go on a 5Ghz 300Mbps router and also tried Air Link with Quest 1 but its too limiting. The max bitrate you can set is about 50-75Mpbs so that it gets through the connection consistently but this is not really enough for the resolutions the Quest 2 needs. The Go was 2560x1280 or 3072x1536 at 60Hz or 72Hz max and the Quest 1 with Link was 3616x2000 or 4128x2272 at 72Hz. the Quest 2 needs higher resolutions at 90hz and 50-75Mbps there is simply not enough in my opinion. The router will also probably run into issues with the consistent high traffic and freeze  crash or will have inconsistent performance causing lag in the stream.  Get yourself a proper 802.11ac router at least to get the 5Ghz 866Mpbs connection.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u5opg5/can_i_use_air_link_for_my_quest_2_with_300_mbps/i53jy3f/'

He was able to play this without issue.  Usually motion sickess is caused by a mismatch between the motion your body is making and the motion your eyes and ears are reporting youre experiencing. For example when youre on a boat on open water the whole boat _moves_ and that motion has nothing to do with you. You take a step forward the water pushes the boat and instead of moving forward maybe you lurch upward. But you can immediately reduce the problem by going above deck and looking horizon because the horizon doesnt move. It gives you a constant frame of reference that matches what your body is doing. VR experiences that move you around and subject you to weird rotations are very similar.  In Ultrawings or any vehicle-based VR game for that matter youre sitting in a vehicle that remains stationary relative to your body. The whole cockpit is constantly in your field of view and it doesnt move around independetly of what you do. So its probably not going to be as bad as you might think.  Its worth a try. Worst case buy it on steam and you can refund it if youve owned it for less than 14 days and have less than two hours of play time. Youll probably know within the first ten minutes if its going to be ok.  Also standard advice for overcoming VR motion sickness that everybody in this sub seems to have forgotten about: the trick is to _stop immediately the moment you feel sick_. Whether thats 2 minutes or 20 minutes doesnt matter. Feel sick? Immediately remove the headset. Youre done for the day come back tomorrow. Do that every day for a couple weeks and youll build up resistance and be able to go longer. The key to this is that you dont want to stay in VR while sick and train yourself via [classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) to associate VR with feeling sick. Remember Pavlovs dog? Yeah dont let that be you.','i53l9w6','/r/oculus/comments/u5id43/ultrawings_2_steam_is_awesome_and_supports_native/i53n9re/'

She had a little bit of a hard time with the joystick controller when playing as Carley. You could cast that game and have others make suggestions as to what the reaperman should do. Basically its a platformer where the reaperman moves things in the environment and Carley gets to the end of the level. The table tennis and mini golf are better for shorter sessions were people take turns. None of those games have motion sickness issues so they would work for new players. In all 3 cases you need to share a code to join which is kind of a pain. Carley can be played seated the other 2 you need to stand.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u5rp8w/best_multiplayer_for_in_person_party_playing/i53tkh0/'

The mod simply needs Half-Life 2 to be installed and then youre all ready to run the greatest way of playing one of the best games of all time (no fooling with Gmod configs other mods etc.). Cabalistic and DrBeef also added full MSAA support (which looks AMAZING in VR) and Vulkan instead of DX9 so the performance is fantastic (with headroom for things like additional graphic mods etc.)  Theres work to upscale some of the textures but thats an ongoing sideproject that hasnt been completed yet. For this video I grabbed an existing texture pack for HL2 that replaces 100% of the textures and it makes a HUGE difference in VR (as original textures are fairly low resolution). Its so much fun to be able to look at details close up in VR.   If youve already played HL2 even 100 times in the past get ready to play it in a completely new way! The physicality alone is amazing in VR. Take a look at how you can spin the blocks in the playground just by hitting them or the way you can play tetherball with a corpse in Ravenholm. Shootouts by physically dodging for cover manually reloading your guns etc. is also insanely fun.

As long as the basic VR interaction is solid enough (and it is [we have other videos of that](https://youtu.be/Nybiex_D6B0)) that automatically puts it above the vast vast majority of Quest games. Thinking of full-length campaign experiences on there what is there? Resident Evil 4 is absolutely fucking tremendous The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is too. Arizona Sunshine is decent enough but its quite dated and is nearly just a horde shooter with actual levels theres very little depth to the exploration or story. Medal of Honor: Above & Beyonds gameplay is solid but holy hell the overall design of the campaign is terrible Im amazed it came out of Respawn. Talking SideQuest Ive only played Half-Life 1 and Blue Shift and while theyre good enough theyre still incredibly janky and the reload is a simple button press. I expect the rest of the DrBeef ports are similar though feel free to correct me if Im wrong.  The Quests game library is a weird hill to die on anyone with a PSVR or PCVR setup could tell you that. It has a lot of recurring gameplay games Beat Saber and Contractor$ being great examples of what I mean but it very much lacks high-quality campaigns like this.','i559ly7','/r/oculus/comments/u5x5l0/upcoming_halflife_2_vr_mod_feels_like_a_modern/i55i218/'

If you are using windows 11 this is a known issue (Oculus actually states that 11 is incompatible). That being said a google search should find some work-arounds (involving running in debug mode).   The second issue is that the Oculus software may be using the integrated graphics instead of your discrete GPU (laptops usually have both options and default to integrated to lower power drain and heat). You can check by opening task manager while your game is open and finding the game on the list of open processes. It should show which GPU is being used.

And I bought my headset I think in like the fall of 2020 so I must have gotten it pretty damn close to when it got discontinued.   I never realized how long it had already been out when I purchased it and that it was nearing its deathbed. Is there a replacement for it within the Rift series or have they just been assuming people will buy the Quest 2 now instead?   If the Rift S still performs on PCVR better than the Quests it would seem odd that they would discontinue their best PCVR experience without an at least equivalent if not superior experience.','i54xlts','/r/oculus/comments/u5xkaz/if_the_oculus_quest_1_2_can_use_air_link_to/i560pai/'

Im sure they will continue to improve the Q2s PCVR performance.  Does this mean that they will never produce another dedicated PCVR headset is anyones guess.  If you have a strong enough PC and a good router/wifi setup the wireless PCVR results can be very good.  My results with my Q2/rtx3090 using Air Link are much better than my old Rift S.  Once you experience good wireless PCVR its pretty hard to go back to being tethered imho.  If you dont have a particularly strong PC (esp.gpu) and an Ethernet connection to a 1gig router with dedicated 5Ghz wifi close by then I think you should stick with your Rift S.','i560pai','/r/oculus/comments/u5xkaz/if_the_oculus_quest_1_2_can_use_air_link_to/i567owr/'

(Oculus Go Owner)','Because Facebook has problem if they cant sell VR to large audience. The COVID had been great push for Facebook Microsoft and Google to get their tech to remote workers as now never before was easier to get people realize what work can be done out of office.  But that excuse is now over. And now you need to sell future products by their features.  You cant sell $2000 HMD like you can $350. And Facebook knows they need to push directly as low they can.  So if they can make $1000 class device to be sold at $700 then that is huge victory. But still it isnt $350. And they need to get something that drops to that price.  Personally if I would now drop $1000 for VR. I would put extra $600 and I would take Pimax 5KX or something that is their at least 150-210° FOV. As I dont have lighthouses or controllers.  If Facebook would come to offer $1000 HMD with 70° FOV as Q2 has I would laugh at them. But for $300 I would consider it.  The new lens tech is exactly to get devices smaller. No more empty space wasted inside. But that must bring wider FOV as that is immersion creator.','i55ji2v','/r/oculus/comments/u5mgh9/i_probably_cant_afford_project_cambria_so_im/i56gdat/'

Once you have done that check if the video is automatically synced on your headset by going to the apps and select files. You can tap the video and see if you are able to manually sync it. Then we recommend reinstalling the app if you have not yet tried that restart the headset and try again. If you still have an issues with downloading the file please reach out to our support team that will be more than happy to continue to assist you!

Looking at your settings. In the Debug tool you have the Encode Bitrate way too high for your GPU. leave it at the default.   In the Oculus App settings both your render resolution and refresh rate are too high for your GPU. However for Beat Saber you might be able to get away with lowering the render resolution and keeping the refresh rate at 120Hz.   And Dont get a 3050 its not worth it. Things are slowly getting back to normal and stocks seems more plentiful. So prices should start to come down. So hold on to what you have for  the moment rather than buy a piece of crap card like the 3050.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6508c/can_anyone_help_me_with_my_performance_headspace/i572odb/'

The Quest 2 controllers actually use AA batteries meaning you will never need to recharge them just change batteries when the time comes. To change them you just have to apply pressure on the small eject icon molded into the plastic of each grip roughly opposite from the location of the trigger button.

Of course this might be because the 20x was pretty crap compared to the 10x.     Obviously the 2080ti is faster than a 1080ti but with such a small improvement that most skipped it entirely and instead upgraded to the 3060ti/3070 instead.','i56oty4','/r/oculus/comments/u67meb/will_this_pc_work_well_for_vr_gaming/i57891v/'

You do need a Mac Linux an Android device that can use SideQuest and connect to the Oculus using USB or Wi-Fi ADB or a Windows computer than can run SideQuest.  There are two methods I know of to install it one being just installing the APK from inside SideQuest itself or you could install a file manager using SideQuest and install the APK from inside the quest. Ill link a YouTube tutorial on how to use both methods below :)  Installing from SideQuest itself - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIbSYRc0ICk  Installing using a file manager - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNPB1F3OfUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNPB1F3OfUU)  &#x200B  Hope this helps :)  \- TG20','-','/r/oculus/comments/boeo58/adblock_for_oculus_browser/i57j2zx/'

First of all please make sure to review the [compatibility requirements.](https://support.oculus.com/140991407990979)  Please note that Air Link’s performance might be impacted if the Wi-Fi channel switches from 5-GHz to 2.4-GHz during a session. To avoid this behavior you can either create separate networks for the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands or disable the 2.4-GHz band altogether. Please consult the manual of your router for more information. If youre still running into difficulties with Wi-Fi performance on Air Link try using a dedicated router for Air Link gameplay.  First check that the headset works properly when used on its own so without the use of the Air Link functionality. Remember to also check that you have no cable connected (such as the link cable) at the same time as the Air link functionality. Indeed if the air link functionality is activated as well as the link connected this will generate a conflict between the two. If you can please try with another PC which is of course compatible with this functionality. This would greatly help in the diagnosis.  Check the quality of your fiber speed. For information a very good quality is between 30-60 ms a good quality between 60-100ms. Beyond that it will not be powerful enough to support technology such as virtual reality with quality.  Here are some additional optimizations that we invite you to perform in order to try to restore the situation:  - Please only connect a monitor a keyboard and a mouse to your computer (no other peripherals for the moment).  - Disable most Software and apps that you do not use during this test period.  - Please disable your antivirus real-time scan during this test period.  - Please check your available space on your PC in terms of storage.  - Try another Windows user account with administrator permissions for this: https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/cr%C3%A9er-un-compte-d-USER-ou -d-local-admin-in-windows-10-20de74e0-ac7f-3502-a866-32915af2a34d.  If after that the situation persists the best solution will then be to contact our technical support right here: [support website.](https://ocul.us/ContactSupport). Do not hesitate to attach in your message a video showing the situation. Here is an explanatory link on how to record an in-game video: https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/social-features-and-sharing/record-video-oculus/?locale=en_EN. You will also be asked for your log files. This is why you can already collect them by following this procedure :   1. Please connect your Oculus device to your computer          2. Find your Oculus installation directory (Generally this will be located at C:\Program Files\Oculus)         3. Navigate to Support and then oculus-diagnostics         4. Double-click OculusLogGatherer and wait for an executable to appear         5. Select Get All Logs         6. This will create a .zip file on your desktop. Please attach that zip file to your email or chat.  These files will allow us to analyze in more depth the possible conflicts of computer hardware versions on the drivers etc.  Regards','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6ct7q/oculus_camera_overheating/i57jlq7/'

Nvidia traditionally beats its previous generation by 2 tiers (a 980 would be matched by a 1070).  On the 10x-20x transition this moved to just a single tier the only upgrade to a 1080ti was not matched by a 2070ti infact only the 2080 matched it leaving just the 2080ti as an upgrade path.This got totally flipped by the 30x series though a 2080 is beaten by 3 tiers all the way to a 3060ti meaning the upgrade path from the 20 series is far larger than ever seen before.  Youre absolutely right that its not just about generations you keep harping on about it while nobody is arguing it.  But you are totally forgetting that generational improvements and Nvidias tiered product lineup IS a very important aspect that cant be ignored by blind generational fanboyism.','i57g5ur','/r/oculus/comments/u67meb/will_this_pc_work_well_for_vr_gaming/i57kyqi/'

Spokesmanship is not my forte afterall and you do indeed need schooling because you are confidently talking about something you very clearly do not understand I dont say this to degrade you but to educate you so that you might not make such a tit of yourself in the future.  The generational leap between 20x and 30x is the largest we have seen so far thats not an opinion its a fact.  Nvidia have always worked on the generational jump that someone can get xx80 (or xx70 or xx60) performance from a new xx70 card (or xx60 xx50 etc).  Giving an upgrade the chance to either sidegrade to a new xx70 for the latest features or upgrade to an xx70ti xx80 or xx80ti.  The 30 series however made huge improvements in transistor technology.Those going from a 2080 had the option to sidegrade to a 3060ti or upgrade to a 3070 3070ti 3080 3080ti (or even go beyond to a 3090 or 3090ti).  This is a huge generational gap being able to get the same performance out of a card literally 4 tiers apart and having a huge choice of potential upgrade options.  P.S You are just wrong. Are you saying that my 3080ti must be lots slower than a 3090 because its another tier up? Dont put words in my mouth if thats what I was saying thats what I would have said.  If this is still too complex then what else can I say?

That waffle in your wall of text means nothing to these people who just want to play fast VR at great visuals / resolutions.  The 30 series up until the 3080 is crap WHEN compared to what they can buy used for the previous generation top end cards.    when I last upgraded my 2080ti was still able to run anything I threw at it.  I work hard so treated myself and my sons to the same as me.  Point is false economy to get a 3050 - 70 when you can pick up something as great as the 2080ti.  Nvidias numbering has always been a way to prise money out of buyers pockets.  They see the numbers people who know nothing will tell them some crap about the newer = better/faster.  Its a shitty branding for users not in the know.  But to say that a 3060 is a great card for VR gaming is just wrong.  Its passable at best.  No better than mid range which will drop fast.','i57oaw5','/r/oculus/comments/u67meb/will_this_pc_work_well_for_vr_gaming/i57po4i/'

A lot of pre-built systems cut many corners one of the most important is the mainboard.  Not all can be very upgradeable or even on a level with other mainboards sporting the same chipset.  Its quite a minefield for non savvy potential buyers looking for the right system for their needs.     I would say 16gb of system memory (minimum) a good **branded** motherboard (ASUS Gigabyte MSI Asrock etc..) Intel imo is definitely the CPU to go for (less compatibility problems overall) but minimum would be an i7 8700k.. Still a fantastic chip.  A minimum of an SSD -> 500GB.  If I was you I would find a website/shop that will put together a PC that you have part picked.  Obviously the OS can be installed by yourself.  You just need the system built.

Its not apparent when the longer sides are stretched causing the shorter sides to bulge outward. The real problem is going to be that even if you get it to fit perfectly when you put the headset on your face is gonna press into it and fuck it up again. So be prepared to constantly have to adjust it. Recommended solution: Get a third party face cushion theyre more comfortable and dont creep into your field of view.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6ctp9/anyone_know_why_this_never_fits_the_normal/i582vg0/'

It has very realistic shooting and firearms (you can literally load individual bullets into mags).  Its more survival horror kind of (similar to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games if youre familiar..) So i wouldnt say its more action packed necessarily but i do find the gun play a lot more satisfying (albeit if youre into more realism in your games)  I also hold Blade & Sorcery in high regard but I think Into the Radius is my favorite native VR game.

(The normal silicon cover that comes with the quest 2 and I have it placed over the fabric thing)','I have both and I infinitely prefer the silicone cover. The VR cover has even worse fit issues than what OP is experiencing because you have to bend a relatively flat leather pad onto the curved face mount. You end up with a lot of folds in the leather and those folds end up leaving a lot of weird marks on your face after a long VR session.  The foam pad underneath the VR cover is also extremely soft so everything smushes down into your face and leaves almost no breathing room. A few rounds of Beat Saber and youre literally pouring sweat out of your headset. Doesnt help that the leather keeps the heat in. It ends up feeling really icky with just a little bit of sweat.','i58hxss','/r/oculus/comments/u6ctp9/anyone_know_why_this_never_fits_the_normal/i58ta4t/'

So for what its worth I have the original 64Gb and thats fine for me but most are PCVR games.  That said MOH Above and beyond is around 42Gb for the Quest 2 but 172 for PCVR.  So just that game alone on my Quest pretty much fills it up with the system software and the few titles like tiltbrush etc.  Also I feel like Cambria might be a game changer.  There were/are rumors of a Quest Pro/3 that might be worth waiting for.  Also MacinVR (youtuber) mentioned these guys in a recent video and is suppose to be a Quest 2 competitor.

Not sure about whether the foam has a stronger resistance than the VR cover one.  The sportswear fabric one actually looks REALLY interesting. The real test is to see how easy it is to dry with a paper towel.

Why they would need to verify it is complicated but thats what a miner does to boil it down as much as possible.  The way they verify these transactions requires them to perform tasks kinda like REALLY complex puzzles that are very hardware intensive and they get more complicated as the total performance of every miner mining the coin increases.      CPUs GPUs and ASICs are the most popular hardware to use for mining (though there are other methods). Since CPUs are largely ineffective with the most profitable to mine currencies theyre mostly ruled out and ASICs are decently controversial since ASICs outclass everything else and cost thousands of dollars so if a bunch of people are using ASICs then nobody else can compete and it creates an unfair playing ground. Because of this many cryptocurrencies using what I would assume is some sort of tech magic disable the use of ASIC mining for their currency.   &#x200B  Basically the wealthier miners use ASICs and everybody else uses GPUs. Since serious miners often try to get their hands on as many GPUs as they can that leads to really high demand and really low supply meaning the price goes up.','-','/r/oculus/comments/8aceie/what_is_crypto_mining/i58y178/'

Thanks so much for playing and hope you enjoyed it.   We recently released a patch that solved the in-game menu issue some players experienced playing via Airlink and Virtual Desktop. Essentially some platform mapping would override our game settings but thats been resolved in the latest update by tying the menu to either X or Y depending on your hardware.  Thanks for the dial and statue report we will look into it ASAP as this hasnt been reported before. I take it the objects were not available in your inventory when you reloaded? Puzzle specific objects you interact with can end up in your inventory on reload to ensure they are readily available and to avoid too much backtracking.

What was weird is that there were no popups from avast telling me that it was blocking the headset which leads me to believe that it could have been a coincidence. Hopefully not though.

I havent seen it happen in free-roam games... yet. There appears to be a bug in the Oculus Link software encoder... and I can tell when the white band is going to happen because the image will look overly-compressed and artifacted before the white line buildup becomes noticeable.  There is a solution on the Oculus forums that involves a painful process of rolling back your Oculus software to a much earlier version. This only further demonstrates that this a major bug in Oculus own software... and after more than a year they havent bothered to fix it.','-','/r/oculus/comments/n43myj/weird_whitegrey_shadow_overlay_that_sometimes/i5a51qm/'

I have friends that have not had an issue with it so it probably just depends on the width of the frame of your glasses.   Regarding the lens inserts I bought eh VR-Wave inserts and they are absolutely worth it. One of the things I like most about theirs is that they come with a small frame that fits around each headset lens and it allows the lens inserts to magnetically connect fo easy removal for when a friend uses the headset.  10/10 would recommend.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6ty9f/people_with_glasses_do_you_wear_your_glasses_with/i5agm9l/'

Early on it took a while to find the right way to put it on but its mostly ok now that Im used to it. Sometimes one side of my glasses will get stuck on the way in and Ill have to slide a finger into the headset to push it in deeper. And sometimes the weight gets distributed unevenly on one of my ears and I have to juggle everything around to rebalance it. And routinely when I take the headset _off_ the glasses stay inside rather than coming with my head.  But again...its mostly ok. It is a bit frustrating when something doesnt load properly and I have to take it off to see my monitor only to click some something or reload and then immediately put the headset back on. Or when Im coordinating with a friend and go from having headset on to taking it off to see my screen to start up discord then straighten glasses --> put on headset --> reach in to fix glasses --> put on discord headphones --> cant hear anything --> take headset off --> fix it --> repeat.  Yeah ok. Its annoying. But manageable.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6ty9f/people_with_glasses_do_you_wear_your_glasses_with/i5awna5/'

Theres also SculptVR but thats a bit more blocky and has fewer features I think...All of these are PC apps and wont run in standalone mode on your Quest (not sure about SculptVR though)   &#x200B  Other sculpting apps include Kanova and Unbound Alpha.   &#x200B  If you want the pure painting experience check out either Vermillion or Paint VR. Another amazing app is Quill has quite a steep learning curve but allows for animation as well.     AnimVR FlipSide Studio and Tvori are also awesome for animation. A really fun app for street art is KingSpray graffiti.  &#x200B  In standalone you can try out Tilt Brush (or its variants MultiBrush and OpenBrush) as well as Gravity Sketch.   &#x200B  Lying down and working is tricky on the Quest because of the Guardian system had this issue when creating a training app for astronauts. It can be managed though there are some hacks if you search online.  &#x200B  Hope this helped :)','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6g9mx/oculus_quest_2_and_vr_sculpting/i5b6yco/'

My recommendations would be to:  - stick with teleporting movement styles until you get your VR legs before graduating to smooth movement  - little freeze ups can happen during loading screens or little otherwise which can make you start feeling dizzy. When this happens close your eyes if you try to fight through it youll just feel worse and worse.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6z967/new_to_oculus_quest_2/i5bdbio/'
'i5bdczm','2022-04-19 00:36:27','MetaQuestSupport','u6g9mx','oculus quest 2 and vr sculpting','Hello there. Were glad to see your interest to get back in VR with us! The Rift S uses five sensors while the Quest uses four. The ultra wide-angle sensors on Rift S are primarily used to create a 3D map of the users environment which helps locate the headset and controllers in a known space so the Rift S can work and keep the user safe. The Quest uses four sensors and computer vision algorithms track users exact position in real time without the use of external sensors. Regarding the monitors if you want to use the Link cable to connect your Quest to your PC having two monitors can create issues with the software hence why we would advise you to disconnect one of them when you use the Quest 2 to avoid possible troubles. The cable used to connect the two is a USB-C type and you can find all about it here: https://www.oculus.com/accessories/oculus-link/ The Quest 2 is designed for standalone use so you can freely roam around and there are a multitude of Apps designed to bring out the best of your creative vein like SculptrVR and Gravity Sketch. Lastly you can still connect your Quest to the Mac/MacBook using a standard USB-C cable it just won’t do as much as it would on a PC which have the Oculus App designed for it. Typically you can use it to transfer files such as pictures or movies. During the initial setup you will also have to pair your Quest to your iPhone in a simple process that you can read about here: https://support.oculus.com/1178714089211378  If you have any remaining questions just let us know!','-','/r/oculus/comments/u6g9mx/oculus_quest_2_and_vr_sculpting/i5bdczm/'

As to your $30 you might be better off using it for one high-quality game with a lot of replay value maybe a popular multiplayer game like Onward or Pop One.  If you do want to stick to lower-priced games a couple that stand out for me are Walkabout Minigolf and Thrill of the Fight (boxing). It really depends on what youre into. But theres no $5 games worth buying just stick to free stuff at that point.','i5duwrx','/r/oculus/comments/u7chb0/hello_i_just_got_the_quest_2_what_games_should_i/i5gbev9/'

Physics simulations of ragdolls are chaotic in nature and so the resulting simulation is very sensitive to initial conditions. Even a simple double pendulum exhibits chaotic behaviour. When two players are in multiplayer any latency at all will cause their PC to render different ragdoll simulations. You could try to correct these mistakes through networking but it would result in very janky physics whenever position or momentum gets updated.','i5cs0gb','/r/oculus/comments/u775uu/what_could_they_show_at_the_oculus_gaming/i5gken7/'

Be it in a electronics shop or from a friend/family member? If you already had a PSVR you will most likely not have the typical VR honeymoon effect when experiencing it for first time so a short test should be enough to evaluate if its worth.  In terms of ease-of-use it should be a lot better same with resolution and SDE. Dont expect good graphics though as even the base PS4 is more powerful than Quest 2 hardware.','i5futnk','/r/oculus/comments/u7nqa4/worth_it_to_buy_a_oculus_quest_right_now/i5gw25p/'

The others (tracking and display) could well be software or hardware. Intermittent issues are even worse as there is no guarantee any given troubleshooting step has had a positive effect or if the issue just happens to have no reoccured yet.   General tips for any sort of support call (with any company for any device/service):    - Describe the symptoms not the assumed cause (or you end up at best wasting time chasing the wrong problem).    - Detail as exactly as possibly any troubleshooting you have done (everyone wants to skip as much of their flowchart as possible give them the ammunition to do so).    - Open one ticket for each separate issue: multiple tickets for each issues invites someone-else-appears-to-be-working-on-it delays and one ticket for multiple issues means only one of your issues will be worked on at a time.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u7nxot/does_oculus_not_honor_their_warranty/i5h0lkd/'

The point really is that shack is an impressive feat and is capable of pulling a lot more out of the quest.  The other finalists for the mapping contest also look great.  I wont deny that many shack maps look like shit but thats not a limitation of the game but the independent creators.  Theres a bit too much porting maps from old games or minecraft stuff but its possible to make something on quest that looks almost PCVR standard.','i5h3kwq','/r/oculus/comments/u7o0b9/boneworks_creators_to_reveal_next_vr_game_at_meta/i5h6apt/'

I started oculus app on my phone and then started a game and i could play the game and saw the menu and all but if i quit the game its back to blackness! Then i went into developer mode on quest 2 and turned on guardian that i had turned off and then i powered off the headset then on. And this time it worked perfectly. But as soon as i disable guardian in developer menu and then i restart or power off and on the blackness is there AGAIN! So the only way i can use the oculus now is to either have guardian ON forever OR have it off then start oculus app on phone and start a game in the app and then im able to navigate the menu and choose another game or what ever as long as i dont just quit the game i started through  the phone app i can switch to other games but if i only choose to quit the game i started through the phone app it goes back to blackness.','-','/r/oculus/comments/nykwra/my_quest_2_stuck_on_black_screen_after_update/i5hletw/'

Go team!  Seriously though for several years now I had serious concerns about VR. We keep getting low-effort shovelware or ports but very few titles of actual substance. If you compare hardware launches - like Nintendo Switch -  to the launch of Quest 2 the quality variety and volume of decent software on Quest 2 is laughably poor. And it keeps getting worse. And now another year of shallow short lukewarm offerings to look forward to. Indie game devs will probably clutch it again but its sad to see we have yet another year with nothing truly substantial in VR gaming.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u7zi9d/meta_quest_gaming_showcase_tminus_one_hour/i5i9toa/'

But being said they need a base game to use in order to port it to VR and we can only assume itll be the Definitive version so we can hope itll be in a superb state when itll be used as a base for the port.','i5igefc','/r/oculus/comments/u81xh2/this_is_what_mark_looks_like_after_todays/i5ih3ms/'

We dont know what this pro headset will cost will probably be exactly the same as Cambria whatever that will end up being because just like how the Pico 3 and Quest 2 is very similar they seem to be using the same factories as Facebook/Meta.  The Pico 3 Link has 256GB of storage (includes a proper link cable) and costs the same as the 256GB Quest 2 but only available in Europe and only a bit above 20 000 units for now definitely not something youd buy unless you want to beta test not that Facebook/Meta isnt doing the same with their buggy software.','i5h8fcv','/r/oculus/comments/u7w8v6/chinese_analyst_pico_will_release_a_pro_headset/i5iirrp/'

Easily Convert 2D video into 3D SBS Stereoscopic VR Video (as well as live filtered conversion playback)','Thats pretty much it some slight modifications to avisynth script with some frame rendering and depth simulation u cAn soft patch your system so that windows media player or 3d vision to play avisynth scripts which utilize directshow and run the frame separation angle adjustments between left and right frame and set a virtual scale depth so id say from what i read on the topic yes.   I was trying to find a full retail version of 3dfier directshow filter for live conversion but i couldnt find where you could by that right now and its seriously outdated and wouldnt work right for vr.  They dropped support for that back in xp or vista? Said theyd make a new release but couldnt find.  Found some trial copies of the filter that timed out after 10 min and could barely implement those dll’s or exes properly plus thats retail so not a true free solution.   I found an avisynth avs script on 3dblogs that served well with a complete guide of about 15+ very lengthly steps.   Tried that all out over a day keeping in mind conversion is a huge tax on cpu and ram plus movies blow up to over 40+ gb then shrink back down.   On a reg quad a movie took 3 hrs. My rig pumps through an avg short movie in 30-40 min? Ao then i found more info on the live conversion patch to make ur media player accept avs scripts direct hooking into avisynth’s dll and an mt.dll which allowed for multithreaded live filtering.   Started refining the process widdling down un needed files and threw it all together into 2 powershell scripts that do all the dirty work for the least amount of interaction possible.   Theres about a 4% interaction yet i will work out in my gui ver of my script with embedded screen and app shortcut key macros. Then use an invisible execution script to wrap the thirdparty stuff offscreen. Long answer. Sorry.

'i5ikahq','2022-04-20 11:42:33','JorgTheElder','u81xj2','How do i play Games from official oculus store in quest 2 to the PCVR quest 2','**Oculus Cross-Buy a Primer:**  The Quest and Rift *(Quest + Link = Rift)* are two very different platforms and they each have their own stores. If you access the store on the Quest *(without out Link/AirLink/VD)* you are on the Quest store. If you access the store from the PCVR software you are on the Rift store.  If you use the web or mobile app you can choose the store from a list.  Apps that give you support for both platforms for one price/buy are called ***cross-buy*** titles.  Because of the resources required to support both platforms *(and sometimes due to licensing issues)* not all games support cross-buy. If a game does not support cross-buy you have to buy it on both platforms to play it on both platforms.   It is easy to identify a *cross-buy* title. The *Oculus Store* description for an app *should* always show the devices you are buying a license for.  * If it says **both** *Supports Rift* **and** *Supports Quest* in the description it is a *cross-buy* title. * If it lists only a single platform you are only buying a license for that single platform.  The *Oculus Store* also has *Cross-Buy* sections: [Quest Cross-Buy](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/section/2335732183153590/#/?_k=keawn3) / [Rift Cross-Buy](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/section/2336123376469541/) - *They should always have the same apps but for some reason they dont.*  &nbsp  *Note that there are data issues that can prevent both devices from being listed in the description of a cross-buy title. I would always check the Cross-Buy section if both devices are not listed.*  &nbsp  *Additional note. Nothing in a Humble-Bundle can ever be cross-buy unless it includes Oculus Store keys. Steam Store purchases are never cross-buy with the Quest without Oculus Store keys.*','-','/r/oculus/comments/u81xj2/how_do_i_play_games_from_official_oculus_store_in/i5ikahq/'

It would be acceptable if you could reset the floor level but that option is disabled with guardian off.  Why?! What sense does that make?  Also passthrough is also completely disabled with guardian off.  Why?  I still want to use passthrough to see something in reality.  What is the logic in not letting you use the cameras cause you dont have a guardian.  Sometimes software does annoying things but at least you can see the logic in why they did that.

Is it too much to ask for them to just find a consistent theme and just stick with it? Medieval dungeons? Heck yeah sign me up. More of those wish.com combine soldiers on balls and textureless zombies? I guess if you were a fan of the meta world of Boneworks but for me *that* was the reason why I couldnt get into it. It gave off a certain tech demo sandbox feeling that wasnt immersive for me like how for example Alyx was. It felt like they couldnt make up their minds for a theme and just stiched together the assets they played with while developing the physics system.      It looks like they are building a quasi metaverse/platform for minigames with different themes and for future addons. Which means the zombies and rolling holosoldiers are here to stay :(','-','/r/oculus/comments/u7zi9d/meta_quest_gaming_showcase_tminus_one_hour/i5ir6w7/'

Ever notice how light and hollow an Xbox One Series X controller feels in comparison to an Xbox 360 controller? Hell remember the original Xbox One controller? The triggers were stiff sure but it still felt like a solid controller. Now the controllers are prone to breaking after falling out of your lap. Ive had to replace my Series S controller four times and my series X twice. I still have my Xbox 360 wired controller and my Xbox One original controller. Aside from the rubber on the analog sticks being worn clean they still work.  Notice how whenever you look for kitchen appliances on BuyItForLife every single post for standing mixers for example is something along the lines of Go with KitchenAid their stand mixers are incredible! Ive been using the same mixer for nearly thirty years! followed by people giving stories about how their brand new stand mixer of the exact same model would crap out on them after half a year of super casual use?  Shareholders are legally entitled to the most money a business can make at any given time. Once youve slashed wages torn away benefits layoff employees so the ones remaining do the work of five others theres not really much else to do but use cheaper and less materials on the goods to lower cost even further with proprietary parts only the manufacturer owns while still increasing the cost of the good to keep it in line with inflation as if the reduced material savings wasnt way more than the cost of inflation.','i5gna3z','/r/oculus/comments/u7nxot/does_oculus_not_honor_their_warranty/i5j9cka/'

Now turn this off. No we wont honor our warranty now turn this off too. Great you have nothing running on your computer and all your peripherals are unplugged giving you great inconvenience to do all of these steps when you want to play VR and then undoing them when you want to use your computer for literally anything else.

Anyways I really don’t have any issues selecting 120 Hz. Only when I ran the oculus software for the first time I had to select and apply 90 Hz first only then 120 Hz option became available.

While Saints and Sinners might be another zombie game its easily one of the best. Good weapon feel fun zombies good sense of tension high levels of interaction and exploration very well done NPCs (you can even kill them changing story stuff)...so certainly worth trying if you havent.  2. Moss while just from a God perspective you actually control the mouse AND interact with the environments physically like reaching out to move stuff. Also if you like platformers in general the perspective is really cool what with 3D depth looking closely at stuff...like Saints and Sinners you are selling it short in your head.  3. Boneworks has a full single player campaign and while its weird it was pretty good. Think Portal type story...pretty trippy. Certainly worth checking out...the sandbox stuff is just another part of the game.  4. Ghostbusters I think people are excited for because itll just be a fun multi-player/co-op game...probably has more to do with it than the actual franchise (look at Phasmophobia).  Other than that thanks for the quick recap!','-','/r/oculus/comments/u86ygo/meta_quest_gaming_showcase_2022_quick_recap/i5kf9w1/'

I just bought an Oculus here at my country where it costs 570 dollars bough it on 12 payments otherwise I could never (insane taxes).  I make 600 dollars a month you guys seriously think we can pay for all this games? you guys are insanely privileged. Yeah just support the devs lul its like you guys think people pirate games because they are evil or something. We try to get commodities how we can and we try to not spend money where we can.  Shit I would pay for every single game full price if I could but I cant or rather I have other expenses I deem more important in my life than videogames.  I either buy the game to support the devs or I dont play it and I dont support them. Yeah I rather get the experience anyway if the game is really good I make the extra effort to save some money and pay for it.  Some people cant just buy everything and the idea of if you cant afford it you shouldnt be able to play it is ridiculously laughable and comes from the mightiest privilege high horse.

If less than 48 hours have passed then you should still be able to get that store credit by following these steps (Some people have been able to do it within seven days but this doesnt appear to work consistently in that case.):  1. Go to the following link and select Delete Device Data: [https://secure.oculus.com/my/devices/](https://secure.oculus.com/my/devices/) 2. Perform a factory reset on your actual Quest by powering it off and then pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time for several seconds. You should see a boot menu appear on screen. You can navigate this menu with the volume buttons and use the power button to select the highlighted option. 3. Select the Factory Reset option and then yes to confirm that you want to reset your device. 4. The device will guide you through a short reset process. All data on the headset will be lost but your account and any owned games will be unaffected. 5. Click on your preferred referral link. All links give identical benefits and there is no particular reason to choose one over another. If you live outside the USA then you will also have to add your referrer. I cant help with that process as I am not very familiar with it. 6. Power on your Quest and run through the device setup process including setting your phone up with the Oculus app and linking them. 7. After youre done you should receive a notification that you got the $30 store credit. It may take a few minutes to arrive and you can check at this location: [https://secure.oculus.com/my/payment-methods/](https://secure.oculus.com/my/payment-methods/) Store credit should be listed at the top of the page. Alternatively you can check on the app by tapping your picture in the top left and selecting Payment Methods in the menu that appears.  &#x200B  I hope these instructions help you!

How do I get started?','As an owner of an original oculus and a q2 user I can for sure tell you that there are so many adventures out there without the use of a PC.  Some big favs of mine that I recommend for the all arounders:  - Beat Saber. You can get some decent sweats playing this one. Packs cost more money. But the game is definitely worth the puchase. Can be played with friends competing.  -Echo VR. Its a free very fun game for all who like Frisbee and space. No but be careful can cause motion sickness. Sit down for this one if your real new. Can also be played with friends.  -Population One. Not free but this one is a blast. Youll get nice arm exercise and be playing super fun flying battle royale shooter that can be played with friends.   -Rec-Room. Free to play. Lots of different games are all inside one big game. Also can be a creative game which is an awesome touch imo. You and friends can go into created spaces by the community or play the game developers have offered and created.  -Pavlov Shack. Free on q2. The one I have listed here is only for the q2. Its a free version of that which you can find on pc. Its still a good game. You are basically playing VR counterstrike.  -Blade And Sorcery. An awesome physics combat game. Its not free on neither q2 store or the pc store. Reminder though this game can be a bit not for the feint of heart. As you play as a swordsman(mage) slashing your way through bodies.  As a finish and closer to this novel I cant believe I typed. When it comes to ease of use I enjoy just playing the q2 by itself. I occasionally plug in to the comp with link cable only to play Blade and sorcery on the PC. The quest 2 offers so much more then I think its gets creds for. Have fun with your device and buy a face cover that will keep it clean.your going to sweat )','-','/r/oculus/comments/u8bc15/just_got_an_oculus_can_anybody_tell_me_what_im/i5ks26w/'

I am thinking i might try a different approach with this.  I know it needs work as its just a base starting point that originally was only for me.  Im going to Try to port it over to Python (Powershell seems clunky for what im trying to do and python is better designed for our purpose here) to handle library / applet handing better and i feel it will put out a much nicer gui.   I will see if i can fix the high framerate scene conversion accuracy. The live 2d to 3d needs work. I will try to wrap this ALL into a virtual environment stand alone executable.

But its not going to feel like a Ghostbusters game for people who like the original movies. Its not about the gear and the theme song as iconic as those are. It was the story with that unique mix of horror and humour that made it a good movie.   The way I would imagine a Ghostbusters VR game to play out is that there is a crisis paranormal activity is on the rise again. But the Ghostbusters^tm are nowhere to be found.  You need to try to discover the source of the activity learning about how to be a ghostbuster along the way eventually using the iconic equipment and maybe encountering/saving the original ghostbusters by the end. And as a prize youre allowed to run your own Ghostbusters franchise. (with a 35% cut going to Venkman)','-','/r/oculus/comments/u8b6kd/what_did_people_think_of_the_ghostbusters_vr/i5l0uyf/'

It was the first thing I bought and I’m so happy I did.   When it comes to which of the many 3rd party head strap options to pick from personally I’m on Team BOBOVR M2 Pro all the way. It is a “halo” strap and in my experience the halo straps take the pressure off the face and are so much more comfortable the the regular “squeeze the melon” straps. Also the fact that the M2 Pro has an integrated battery pack means I get more play time. I absolutely love mine and would recommend it to anyone. If you’re worried you may not like it my advice would be to buy it on Amazon or somewhere that allows you to return it hassle free. That’s what I did because I wasn’t sure. But as soon as I got on I found I loved it and so a return wasn’t even considered. Still I liked the fact that I had the option.   If you don’t want/need the battery pack then the M2 (non Pro) is also a really good option.   That’s my recommendation.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u3try8/looking_into_buying_a_quest_2_what_accessories/i5l1cyi/'

Connect your Oculus to PC via cable and crank up the refresh rate to 90 or 120hz.   That or adjust the refresh rate of the game in the Steam setting (Menu button on left controller when Im a SteamVR game).   Another thing is to make sure your VD settings (refresh rate and etc) match the settings of the game and headset.

Those people are not you.  > Until you turn it off on both of them regual link cable will disabled.  Your answer to the question is incorrect. My answer is correct. You only turn airlink on/off in the headset. NOBODY connects a cable to their headset so they can select airlink from the pc app.  The option youre talking about is to setup a device when you havent used airlink before. The OP clearly said he was already using airlink. To use cable after using airlink *you turn it off in experimental settings*. Only.  The feature Im talking about is [this]( https://i2.wp.com/bigtechquestion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/air-link-PC-enabled-highlighted.jpg ). THIS is what you used to have to turn on/off in the app *as well as* in the headset. Now you dont *because they removed it months ago*.  You need to grow up.

Just by itself... probably not.  As far as testing it... you could download the oculus software I think the first test it does is a cable/usb check and so you could at least make sure the cable works and you might be able to get a test image on the display (not sure it may require a sensor to get to the setup portion).  If you can get one sensor you could play some seated controller/joystick based games like Elite Dangerous Jetborne Racing Project Cars DCS etc.  Also some early VR games like Chronos Distance and Overload.  I think Megaton Rainfall may support controller as well.  If you have 2 sensors and two Oculus touch controllers you can play a LOT more games and much more modern stuff though youd optimally want 3 or 4 sensors.  Heres a list of things that tend to die on Rift CV1s:  The cable: be careful with it replacements can cost hundreds.  The internal headset ribbon cable: Theres a little halo of circuitry in the headset that goes to the headphones and to the tracking lights on the back of the headset.  The tracking lights are infrared so you may not notice if they arent working.  With one sensor they dont matter at all.  It has slightly reduced tracking occlusion robustness in roomscale without it but its not a critical failure.  The headphones however you might notice one or both not working.  (If both arent working its HIGHLY likely the tracking lights arent either.)  Again non-critical as you can use a separate pair of headphones or headset.  The headphones themselves can break pretty easily too separate of the ribbon cable failure.  Finally the controllers are actually pretty beefy but if you slam them full speed into a hard object thats still not good for them and of all the parts of the system they are the most likely to be slammed full speed into a hard object.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u8iw53/found_an_oculus_rift_cv1_headset_in_an_ewaste_bin/i5lhasc/'

They will not overcharge over-discharge charge too fast etc. Were not in the era of lead-acid or NiCad batteries with external charger and manual charge management.   The important thing is the same as with any other USB charger: dont use cheap crappy cables and dont use cheap crappy chargers. USB charging is an active process where the device the charger and the cable all play a role in negotiating the required voltage level and current delivery limits and cheap components often ignore the USB PD standard in how they should be behaving.','-','/r/oculus/comments/u8hz6o/will_the_q2_get_broke_while_continuously_charging/i5llprn/'

The main problem in in the user interface. Here we are in an oculus sub and neither program has proper support for the oculus controllers.   In the Dali one I couldnt turn or move so all I could do was navigate from white orb to white orb and then swivel my chair to look around. I did like that the painting was expressed as a 3d sculpture that you could see from different angles. If I could turn around with the controllers and move it would have been better. Also with just one painting to view the experience didnt last long. I do understand that it must be difficult to add more paintings but with only one and without controller support I only stayed a couple of minutes. Add controller support and build it out to a dozen paintings and it will be a fine program.  The Mona Lisa one looked interesting on launch but again no proper controller support. And again it was limited in scope. Entering the museum and standing in that long hall filled with paintings and sculptures but only being able to see just a few was just a tease leading to disappointment. Once all of the cameras were in that room why not spend a day walking down the hall and taking pictures all the way along?  I dont want to sound discouraging as the idea is awesome. This sort of thing is exactly what my wife and I want to experience in VR. However at this point it is just a promising start.','i5dx57h','/r/oculus/comments/u7cjbu/vr_exhibitions/i5lmwta/'

I see that you are doing a masters thesis so you are probably not the developer.  Good thesis topic. Im a developer so what I said in my previous post was more from a developer perspective. Im interested in what you are doing though. Do you have any specific questions about my experience that will help with what you are doing?  I did enjoy seeing the art but as a VR entertainment consumer rather than a techy Id say that there needs to be something more for the VR experience to be better than just looking at the art. The Dali one was better in this respect as it was rendered in 3d and that added something. The Mona Lisa one was basically just looking at a dozen paintings and that can be done better in book form. To make a visit to the Louvre interesting you would have to be able to walk around and look at a lot of other art to make it worthwhile. Multiplayer would also be better so you could visit with a friend and chat about what you see. That would be more like a real life visit.

Meta is adding software and mixed reality enhancements to their mobile headsets. If you buy a used Rift S Im not sure how you would be assured of getting a brand new cable if its not possible to refurbish a cable.   Also note that the rift S may not match your IPD. The distance between its two lenses cannot change.  Read about how Oculuss Palmer Lucky says he cant use the Rift S because the Rift S cant match his IPD.   I can see perfectly in the Quest headsets because their lens separation distance can change. I could see less perfectly in the Rift S because my IPD doesnt match what the Rift S can set as far as mechanical IPD adjustment.  So at the top of my requirements list for any headset is a headset that has  mechanical IPD adjustment. You dont have to be to buy a Meta headset to find a headset with those mechanical ipd adjustment settings.   The good news is according to statistics your IPD has a good chance of being normal in which case none of this matters. But if its not you may want to consider IPD when buying a headset. The G2 among others as a mechanical IPD adjustment','-','/r/oculus/comments/u8j6xs/general_vr_inquiry/i5lx5jv/'

Now that u mention it all if this is all true why on a META QUEST GAMING event u would show almost only PC VR footage trailers?

But were not actually looking at the game and the dialogue probably isnt from the game either. Is it multiplayer? Is it a story-driven RPG? Is it yet another FPS?  Whats the basic ghost mechanic? In the movies they needed multiple people firing beams to pull ghosts into the traps. Is this going to be multi-player only because of that? Or are they going to reduce the t rap mechanic to a simple shoot the thing a bunch to weaken it?  Give me a ghostbusters game with interesting mechanics and Ill give it a try.

Nothing comes up on display but its possible that the software simply wont send an image to the display unless a VR program is running -- and VR programs wont run because the sensor is missing lol kind of a catch 22   > headphones: Those I was able to test surprisingly -- headphones/mic seem to work fine   > lights: When I had a second I pointed my phone camera at the headset -- since I know that phones are able to pick up a tiny bit of the IR spectrum. The dots are visible (and look super cool!) but since I dont know how many there are supposed to be / their location I cant confirm if they all work.   > 3 or 4 sensors: What would be the benefit of having more sensors? Iirc the device originally shipped with one and the touch controllers shipped with another. would more sensors allow you to track in a larger play area?  I suspect this headset came from a university VR lab that upgraded their gear -- since I found it in an e-waste bin at my university. Maybe that means its users have taken better care of it..? lol probably not  do you or anyone else on the sub know if the display will come on even with no sensor? Use VR headsets before but never really seen how they behave with a PC -- do they usually just display an idle screen before a VR program starts or do they do nothing until a VR program starts?

I teach my class content based on the framework my state provides while also teaching the content provided by the business.  My students take a cert test  If the student passes the certification the state district school and sometimes teacher gets a kickback from the business.  I.E.  I teach a game design course for freshman in high school. My kids will take a Unity certification for game development. If they pass it each student will bring in $400-$800 from the business (Unity) depending on which certification to be distributed to the state district school and teacher.   The teacher gets a flat rate of either $25 or $50 depending on the test for the student passing. The district gets about 30% for providing the testing facilities proctors paying for the test other things like computer refreshing. And the majority of our goes back to the school (specifically my department) so we can buy equipment to provide other certifications this can be anything Im able to justify to my district and its tied to a certification.  Im planning on getting VR for my Juniors in 2 years when the cert money is distributed (its delayed by a year and a half).','i5mgajl','/r/oculus/comments/u8l0on/wow_quest_2_is_showing_up_in_class/i5ms5j4/'

I didn’t know that there is an Oculus for Business product. After spending a few mins reading about it I have to say that it is disappointing that it:  - Costs a lot more - Is not able to connect to the Oculus Store - Has been discontinued with no announced replacement  On the Oculus for Business page it suggests that current customers migrate to the consumer devices. The problem is that the consumer product requires a Facebook account. At the same time it’s not good practice to have employees using their personal Facebook account for business purposes. Too many privacy liabilities at stake. And I suspect that Facebook wouldn’t take too kindly to a business creating fake accounts for business purposes. So prospective business clients are caught in a catch 22. If Meta really wants to establish a future for VR that is broader than retail gaming it strikes me that they should be paying more attention to making a business product that is both affordable and fully featured.

After it auto-updated to V39 it loads into this black/3 dots screen and only opening an App from the Oculus Mobile App I can access the menu to either load another app or to access the Settings.  Other things I noticed is that the reboot menu now has a POWER OFF and RESTART options but stiil with the Oculus logo on it when any of it are pressed. And theres this Crystal Atrium new home environment. Oh and there are time that rebooting the Settings menu went to that old like v25 menu with much less options probably some old firmware remained after this v39 update so its all messed up.  Im with Version 39.0.0.88.336.363807235 and Runtime 39.0.0.100.369.363650567  If its someone has another tips on fixing this without doing a Factory Reset would be much appreciated.   I hope they release a fix for this anytime soon so I can disable the Guardian again!  =)))','i5hletw','/r/oculus/comments/nykwra/my_quest_2_stuck_on_black_screen_after_update/i5mxk6r/'

The dots are visible (and look super cool!) but since I dont know how many there are supposed to be / their location I cant confirm if they all work.  Thats a great sign and another thing I wasnt sure if youd be able to test (because I didnt know if it activated them at that point).  If you see any on the back you should be set.

I wonder if the reason they discontinued the previous program is that they recognized this (or a form of this) and are now working on plans to re-approach the business segment in a way that will actually deliver something that meets/exceeds those basic functions you refer to. Considering how much of their reputation and future success Meta seems to be betting on VR I imagine the failure of their first foray into a business product is not lost on them. They have lots of smart hard-working folks there. Im betting some of them are working hard on this exact problem. Id love to be a fly on the wall of their strategic planning session.','i5n9mnd','/r/oculus/comments/u8l0on/wow_quest_2_is_showing_up_in_class/i5ne3ss/'

Every PCVR game renders ones and then sends it to the headset like its just another monitor. Oculus link on quest 12 however after rendering it on PC records it in a compressed video and streams that in to the headset. So you lose as much performance as if you streamed on twitch or shared a screen in discord for example.

If you set your expectations low you may be okay with it.  Stutters latency and low frame rates are - in my opinion - dealbreakers for VR.  Its far more impactful than it is on a flatscreen because in VR youre immersed.  Its very unsettling to move your head and have it lag behind for example.  Or if its a slideshow its very off-putting.  Also consider that the Quest 2 has a lot of processing overhead to do PCVR.  It has to compress the image and audio send these over a USB cable then the headset has to decompress the image and audio and display it.  You need a stronger PC for PCVR with the Quest than you would with a dedicated PCVR headset (it doesnt have to do all the real-time compression / decompression).  Keep all this in mind.  To me it would not be a decent experience at all.  But for you maybe your tolerance for stutters low frame rates and high latency is better than mine so you might find it tolerable.','i5nrujm','/r/oculus/comments/u8vn43/quest_2_linked_to_1050ti_possible_or_not/i5nsig3/'

Its also a single player experience so if you rather play alone this is the better choice.  ATF is all about replayability in fact it relies on it for longevity.  Theres 6 maps or 7 now they just got a new one.  You play thru grinding drops to make yoru guns better to help you better content with higher difficulties to get better drops etc.   And then they added Horde mode.  PVP mode is dead and buried dont get ATF for pvp.  Its a coop experience though you can play alone and populate the game with 3 other bots.

Also as someone who knew a few individuals who worked on the Occulus projects and made massive contributions to it I have to say youre just being obtuse.  The vision for the Occulus was nothing like what its currently becoming under Facebook. When the acquisition occurred AFTER I bought the headset from a company I researched and trusted then came the empty promises from Facebook and the aggressive moves towards advertising. When you pay for a service you don’t expect it to change dramatically especially when privacy becomes infringed.   Hell the only reason Facebook is now Meta is because theyre trying to distance themselves from the awful data mongering and privacy practices that got them in trouble in the first place. It only took zucc 15 seconds into being Meta CEO to tell his first lie and here you are being an apologist for them and pretending as if theres no reason for people to be bitter about the situation.','-','/r/oculus/comments/rzvpi1/dont_want_facebook_dont_buy_oculus/i5rmbh0/'

Increasing investment in Facebook VR and expanding the userbase exponentially from where it is today means other big players will likely enter the market.   As the article points out Zucks vision for the Metaverse is still pretty vague but it seems to loosely resemble something Ready Player One-ish. Im gonna go out on a limb and wager there will be a large number of people who just want to solely treat VR as a gaming platform esp as larger/longer/more content rich games are released. If other companies can swoop in to provide that with minimal extra bullshit I believe theyll have a robust market to support them.','i5rj5e1','/r/oculus/comments/u9gdmj/mark_zuckerberg_metaverse_obsession_is_driving/i5rmg35/'

Its not a short bet infact it is likely a very long bet that they are making.  its kindof the same bet that Gamestop is making.  their NFT marketplace is a bet on the Metaverse and it becoming the future of gaming in 5 10 20 years.  it doesnt seem like much now cause its pretty early on in the process and development/apps/tools/infrastructure/etc are lacking still.    however in the next 20 years there are gonna be a lot of changes coming for metaverse and its going to grow up a lot in that time.  THis is what the play is its a very long play and thats why it doesnt make sense to so many people right now.  psvr2 is gonna have eye tracking.  it makes it easier to render good high res scenes cause you only need high def where you eye is looking.  but this also brings more data for companies to mine.  where were your eyes looking what did you focus on what interests you the advertising oppertunities and marketing and data mining oppertunities for facebook are ginormous if you can get everyone in your ecosystem.','i5ro3by','/r/oculus/comments/u9gdmj/mark_zuckerberg_metaverse_obsession_is_driving/i5rqu4c/'

I think the plastic just becomes brittle in some units Im inclined to think its a manufacturing defect that crops up if the ingredients in the plastic are not handled correctly during fabrication but thats just an educated guess. Whether or not you get a good one will be a crapshoot but it does come with a 2 year warranty.

It’s a very different experience talking to someone in real time seeing their “face” and gestures than it is posting anonymously in text. You still have trolls and griefers but they can be banished or shunned with the  jab of a mute button. Maybe in small increments our dialogue with others online can become more humane and there’s more room for empathy to creep in.   In a place like Altspace discussions occur a lot more organically. People are sharing their thoughts spontaneously and not plotting out every syllable pausing at length to compile links to poorly understood articles in order to punctuate their point. It’s not something I spend much time in because I find that all quite dull mostly but I still recognize there’s some potential there.','i5rtw54','/r/oculus/comments/u9gdmj/mark_zuckerberg_metaverse_obsession_is_driving/i5scfh4/'

Fortnite for example has become a venue for concerts and other large virtual gatherings. (A concert by the hip-hop artist Travis Scott last week drew more than 12 million viewers.) Animal Crossing a whimsical Nintendo Switch game has become a surprise quarantine hit. Millions of people are using Zoom and other video-chat apps to hold virtual game nights cocktail parties and yoga classes on their laptops and phones without the need for special hardware.  >These experiences aren’t fully immersive in the same way that virtual reality is. But they may not need to be. After all the breakout moment for augmented reality — V.R.’s chiller more pragmatic cousin which involves projecting digital objects onto physical spaces — wasn’t fancy Magic Leap goggles or Hololens gadgets but a Snapchat filter that let you turn yourself into a dancing hot dog. We are creatures of habit and it may be that **people simply prefer virtual experiences that don’t require them to strap an expensive computer to their forehead.**  >I told Mr. Cussell my V.R. tour guide that I was still unsure whether my preteen dream of a mass-market virtual reality experience filled with lifelike experiences and plenty of my actual friends would ever come to fruition. He conceded that stand-alone V.R. headsets might remain a niche product for nerds like us. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/technology/virtual-reality.html  Thats how I feel. I use my Oculus mostly for working out doing 3D puzzle and some simple games. And to be honest the entire thing being captured through a Meta/Facebook UI like an unrooted smart phone is absolutely hurting the adoption of the technology.

Would you want this game/app?','So I’ve been trying to work something out for VR Chat.   Some takeaways:   1. the Leap Motion i guess still works but is buggy?  2. The kinect 360 works better than the kinect One.   3. Touch-capacitors strips along each fret are spendy and the strings will damage them.  4. A sound can be recorded as input therefore your note hand can be mapped to varying positions along the neck. Theoretically this is possible… but what about chords? What about reverb? What about additional guitars being sensed by the input device???  5. Actual pass-through hand-tracking??? For VR chat? Iffy.  Verdict: I’m pushing forward with the Leap Motion but it’s gonna need a special mounting arm that reads only the neck in order to prevent the tracking of the second (picking/strumming) hand.  BONUS!  So… for those who want to be in VRChat and just “Look Like You’re Playing More Accurately” I am building some simple gloves with a 3D printer and a sewing machine.

It isolates the latency for GAME ENCODING NETWORKING DECODING. If the numbers show up as yellow or red then that is where you have a problem.  If its GAME then adjust lower the VR Graphics Quality or refresh rate setting to the lowest and see if fixes the issue. If it improves then increase both until you find the sweet spot for your hardware. If not the issue then it might be some setting in the game itself or your GPU drives.  If its ENCODING/DECODING then turn on/off sliced encoding and see if that changes anything. Lower the bitrate all the way down and try a different codec. On your PC the virtual desktop streamer app has a preferred coded setting and its probably on AUTO. Change that to H264 or HEVC and see if that makes any difference as well.  If its NETWORKING then also try lowering the bitrate all the way down and see if that fixes it. if not then your WiFi signal or router is the problem. Get yourself a WiFi analyzer app on your phone and verify your router is not using a channel that other nearby routers are also using. Then turn off or disconnect all other WiFi devices so only your Quest is using the router and see if that helps performance. If you verified its not a signal problem and no other device is competing for bandwidth then it could just be your router itself is not fast enough to handle Virtual Desktop.

If anyone trying to do this cannot get to the button in time take apart the lens surround and disconnect the proximity sensor physically and then the device will give you probably at least a minute or two.  I got my quest 2 because the person that gave it to me broke it and I tried to see if I could get it running (thanks to you I did). But the problem is that they damaged theirs probably more than most which probably \*somehow\* led to my issue.   My quest 2 would load up just like you said it would to a screen to allow adb access but for some reason my ability to select the button was limited to probably less than a second. Bundled with the fact that every time I rebooted my Enable development mode would get disabled. So I just needed more time. Once I entirely unplugged the proximity sensor I had enough time to connect with my phone reenable development mode request access to adb and finally have proper adb access.   Why my system was so unique--I havent a clue but for now the headset works and I am forever grateful.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/suedfd/black_screen_of_death_how_to_allow_usb_debugging/i56i3aa/'

Wed like to advise you to reach out directly to our Support team and let them know if these features used to work for you along with a screenshot of the screen you get stuck on if possible. In the meantime we can also suggest you try the cable with other USB 3.0 ports and test the Link performance with the bare minimum of USB devices connected to PC. The Air Link’s performance might be impacted if the Wi-Fi channel switches from 5-GHz to 2.4-GHz during a session. To avoid this behavior you can either create separate networks for the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands or disable the 2.4-GHz band altogether.

VR Server stuck on OVR Runtime Init','This has been happening up until just now. but I will share what I did I dont know if its magic or any of these solved the issue.   Firstly exit steam virtual desktop and oculus fully.   then go to task manager and end tasks OVR service launcher OVRserver\_x64 then OVR Redir (last because it will restart if its not)    If you dont see these running it means you have their autostart disabled for OVR runtime    in which case it needs to be started I used Revo Uninstaller and within their auto start manager enabled it (this happened previously and only fixed the issue for a short period)     After this I went to my steam location (right click any shortcut and open file location) and right clicked the exe went to properties compatibility and selected run as admin. This gives several warnings that things might not work properly in steam. and Im not 100% certain this helped whatsoever. (I will probably revert this and test again as its a bit of a pain)     I then downloaded oculus and did a repair on the program to which it did some updates.   Then I finally opened steam back up did a file verifcation on SteamVR and the game I was trying to start in this case beat saber.     Then I started Virtual Desktop on the PC then went to my headset started VD on there and started steamVR from the button within the VD software then opened the menu and started my game.      All these specific steps may not be necessary but these are the steps I took before it actually worked. I did not retry at every corner because I felt that might be part of the problem constantly re-bricking steam VR before fixing multiple issues.     I think the biggest one was restarting those OVR tasks in the task manager and getting oculus software repaired. For now its working.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/tyoz9x/steamvr_no_longer_working_vr_server_stuck_on_ovr/i56m0lj/'

But the thing is for air link you need to be using a second router thats not connected internet nothing else is connected to it only your quest is connected to it on the 5GHz channel and that secondary router needs to be directly wired to your computer via ethernet. If you cant do that for some reason or you dont have a second router then forget about air link ever working properly.  Your options are either by a new Wi-Fi 6 router which you can get the cheapest one for about $23 off of Amazon. Or grab a decent USB 3.0 super speed certified cable Thats going to run you a minimum of $30 for a really decent one probably $50 top of the line would be the official Oculus link cable that is fiber optic thats going to run you around $70.      But you should also make sure that you are computer isnt defaulting to your onboard graphics you can test this in this manner before you turn your quest on and before you try to load any PCVR game go into your control panel and device manager and right click and disable your onboard graphics.  Then see if you get the same performance problems.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u61b57/airlink/i56o0cj/'

Tap the headset that is currently paired. 4. Tap Controller then tap the desired controller to unpair. 5. Tap Unpair Controller.  Then: 1. Open the Oculus app 2. Tap Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 in the top left corner of the Oculus app 3. Tap Settings in the bottom right corner of the app. 4. Tap Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 under the users name and email. 5. Tap Controllers then tap Left or Right to choose which hand you’d like to pair.

This usually entails having a very specific profile setup for color correction contrast aspect ratio screen positioning etc. And that is almost always tied to the integrated onboard graphics.  So when you disable the onboard graphics thats what happens That profile is also disabled and it goes to a default setting for your Nvidia or Radeon GPU.  The easiest way to get back to the original profile would be to re-enable it.  This is because the settings and the software for Intel onboard graphics especially are not exportable or easily transferable over to the Nvidia display software.  You could take your time and carefully tweak all the settings etc for the Nvidia radio on GPU to display the same but thats a lot of work that you dont need to really go through if you just enable or disable when youre going to use PCvr.  Its not an issue when youre playing games just on Windows without your VR headset because you can just individually set those apps to use the Nvidia radio on GPU without a problem.  Its only when it comes to steam and steam VR in particular that Ive noticed it tries to default to the onboard graphics.','i56nxms','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u67tr7/are_you_experiencing_lag_stuttering_etc/i56oyio/'

Then on the second router thats connected to ethernet to your computer that only the quest is connecting to wirelessly make sure thats a different channel and then you shouldnt run into any conflicts at all.  If you 100% want to ensure no conflicts whatsoever.  You could actually use different bands completely. By that I mean with your wireless connection to the router that your internets running on connect to the 2.4 gigahertz channel.  Then on the second router thats hardwired to your computer have your quest connect to the 5 gigahertz channel which it should be anyways in general.  But using these two completely different bandwidth should ensure 100% no conflicts or cross interference.  And honestly the 2.4 gigahertz connection shouldnt slow your internet down enough to really matter for gaming.  But for downloading and the maximum bandwidth possible if you have a really fast internet connection you may want to switch back to the 5GHz connection when youre not gaming for the best download speeds.  But in terms of ping And general latency which is the most important factor in online gaming the 2.4 gigger connection should work just fine.','i562k22','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u63r4r/3_routers_1_of_which_is_isp_provdided_causing_any/i56ph7l/'

But for me when I said empirical observation that means I have directly observed this happening. I have disabled my onboard graphics and then ran my computer disconnect from the power supply and the battery literally dies in half the time Then with onboard graphics enabled.   Ive also utilized diagnostic apps to monitor the actual power consumption coming from the entire computer and its nearly doubled when using nothing but the Nvidia GPU as opposed to onboard graphics.  And the Nvidia GPU stays silent the fan doesnt even spin when youre just browsing the internet or using applications that dont require the Nvidia GPU just utilizing the onboard graphics.  I soon as you disable onboard graphics the Nvidia GPU speeds up and regardless of how fast its running how hot its running or how much its utilized that fan is still spinning and not fan will eventually wear out so youre shortening the lifespan of your card and especially on a laptop you cant replace that built-in Nvidia  GPU.

Like it wasnt orienting the space to where you were looking so youd see where you should be looking as you walked through a portal but youd be looking somewhere else.     And also the portal gun wasnt handheld so it looked like a massive thing stuck to your body and you could only aim it by looking at where it would shoot.

Im using Windows 11 which (still unfortunately) makes the whole Link experience very clunky. Its a stuttery mess unless tinkered with a bit. If gaming over Link is a priority then I would definitely recommend using Windows 10. Otherwise you need to have the console window running in focus at all times.  When it works performance is very nice across the board. I mainly use 4128x2096 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. The games I play most frequelntly are Assetto Corsa DiRT Rally 2.0 Squadrons Beat Saber and Half Life: Alyx. The sims are hardest to run in my experience everything else is buttery smooth. The games are always GPU bound the CPU was never anywhere near being a bottleneck. Playing at higher render resolutions I noticed VRAM being sometimes an issue at max resolution HL:Alyx just hangs on startup. I really would prefer a 16GB buffer. This will be less of an issue once DLSS finally becomes mainstream among VR games.  I hope I could help if you have any further questions feel free to follow up!

Like everything the right settings are required.  I suggest you start off with the Oculus Desktop pc app (opt into beta v29 its best right now) and on the device graphics start off with 80Hz refresh and the res slider at  1.1x.  You should also do a usb speed test to make sure your Link cable is getting at least 2Gbps (test is below these graphics settings).  Then open up the Oculus Debug Tool (ODT) and set everything to defaults/zeros except enable link sharpening set distortion Low encoding width = 3664 and bitrate = 300.  Remember to restart oculus runtime services after making changes.  Win10 setting (hopefully you are not win11 lol!) go to graphics settings and turn off hardware  acceleration graphics (HAGS) and go to gaming options and disable Game Mode.  Use nvidia driver 511.79 which I think is best right now.  It may also be a good idea to use DDU to properly uninstall older drivers beforehand.  Then go to nvidia control panel 3d global settings and set everything to defaults except power = prefer max performance and just below that change the default Quality to Performance.  Apply those changes.  Anyway maybe give all this a go and see how you make out.  Good luck mate and cheers.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u640bc/how_to_get_better_performance_out_of_quest_2/i571j5p/'

In order to ensure you have the best possible connection keep the router in the same room as the headset or in line-of-sight and at least 1m (3.3ft) off the ground with a non-mesh network configuration. Air Link issues can sometimes be resolved by completely disabling the functionality on both the PC and the Quest 2. To ensure the process is completed properly use these steps on the PC: Navigate to the Settings section of the Oculus Home app Locate the Beta settings and ensure that Air Link is switched off  If this does not do the trick for you please reach out to our Support directly and if possible include your log files so we can take a deeper look into this issue.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u69wx1/my_quest_2_has_been_lagging_horribly_airlink/i5736wm/'

'i575w9b','2022-04-18 05:03:05','luckydonnie','u5rvcd','All refresh rate options gone after update','Its not a good testing program because the only way to get off PTC is to wait for the normal release to drop.   So if you get a regression like losing the different refresh rates youre stuck for a while with it. Even if it was a worst device breaking bug there is no way to roll back.  They announced the normal v39 release is starting to roll out since last week. So Im keeping an eye for that and keep checking the software update button. Nothing yet.  My main concern is if reports of this issue start to appear for non-PTC users because that would mean they didnt even address this issue the whole time while it was in PTC and decided to push it into regular release.   Pretty much any experimental feature is not guaranteed as that banner say when in that settings panel. They could enable or disable features for A/B testing or whatnot.    I really think the 120Hz and multiple refresh rate options should graduate to core feature. I hope the developers see it the same way. The Quest 2 is more than capable of pushing those higher frames with the right settings and it was one of the main reasons I bought a Quest 2.','i572xmm','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u5rvcd/all_refresh_rate_options_gone_after_update/i575w9b/'

To cover the cost in case people damage it the experience must be very expensive. Therefore nobody will watch it.

The software version after update mismatching your headset can be a reason. People had this problem back when v23 was released. Some managed to get installation of older version. Some managed to get it back just by reinstalling the newest one. For others restart alone was enough. Also another thing.

'i57cvj4','2022-04-18 06:07:59','victoragc','u6brud','hoe much data for VR on vacation','It will depend on the kind of game. If its more like a competitive game it shouldnt use much data since the game will transfer only the absolutely necessary. Even if the developer doesnt compress the data should be at most 1 Gigabyte per hour.  If the game is more like a social game that youll need to download different character models for each player (essentially VR chat) you will most likely add 500 Megabytes per model downloaded (assets are heavy internet consumers) which I think might be underestimated since Im not a VR social games developer. Id advise overshooting by a lot what you may need. Assuming youd meet around 20 people in 1 hour that should be the Gigabyte plus the other 10 Gigabytes of data from downloading player models. 11 Gigabytes an hour.  So yeah if you are playing VR Chat try the biggest plan possible. Otherwise youll probably be safe with a Gigabyte an hour. Add some extra wiggle room for nothing is perfectly calculated and have fun.  You might want to evaluate the delay/ping since it is the biggest fun killer. If youre going out of your country expect it to be bad.  Oh and almost forgot offline games dont need internet unless the developer is evil and wants to have a subscription paywall for playing the game.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u6brud/hoe_much_data_for_vr_on_vacation/i57cvj4/'

Main developer is butthurt that his game isnt doing well compared to what he said one year ago in a video interview. He has personally invested money and years of time to make this game a reality. Clearly got burned out on this and instead of learning the lessons he is going into conspiracy theories that Meta is working against him and not allow him to advertise his game BECAUSE of war in Ukraine. Everyone who has tried the game and did not like the game clearly never played it and is obviously a developer of other fps vr.

When he dies all the other enemies die as well.  Another is to realize the archers are summoned based on Anakims health. Two show up when hes first damaged. Three at 80% health four at 60% five at 40% and six at 20%. They have a cool down between summoning and teleporting around that you can use slow-mo to head shot them while theyre in the cubbyhole. Theres a number of ways to do this. Just realize if Anakim gets near you his auro causes damage so stay away.

The game has physics interactions with the player body which is precisely what anyone opting for teleport movement would \*not\* want to have. But simply disabling them is not an option because some levels rely on them. So that will require some careful working around. And then of course there are the vehicle driving sections which are impossible to adopt to teleport.

Dev can not fathom the idea that this game might be actually not fun at all. They have access to player statistics - they can see how much time someone spent in the game. But who are we kidding apparently youre not allowed to have an opinion until you spent dozen hours playing it - so well beyond refund period (up to 2 hours).

While I have had my MSI Stealth Pro for a few years now it has been maintained fairly well and yet games like Phasmophobia and American Truck Simulator are god-awful on the 1060m in VR hitting temps over 90 degrees (Celsius) and capping at 100% on the GPU at times at least in my experience. So perhaps its a hit or miss but I can guarantee that if it is playable for you it definitely will not be amazing and ultimately that kind of ruins it entirely because VR is supposed to make you feel immersed within games as if you are really there and last time I checked the human eye doesnt run under 30 fps so yeah I would highly suggest just buying/building a PC thats containing a graphics card at least in the 2-series field because that should be able to handle most experiences in VR just perfectly.','ho349je','/r/OculusQuest/comments/lnz7x3/oculus_link_compatibility_with_a_gtx_1060m/i57qaut/'

This referral link is for new users in the USA.  ***  # Already activated your Quest?  Not a problem! If less than 48 hours have passed then you should still be able to get that store credit by following these steps (Some people have been able to do it within seven days but this doesnt appear to work consistently in that case.): 1. Go to the following link and select Delete Device Data: https://secure.oculus.com/my/devices/ 2. Perform a factory reset on your actual Quest by powering it off and then pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time for several seconds.

Select the Factory Reset option and then yes to confirm that you want to reset your device. 4. The device will guide you through a short reset process. All data on the headset will be lost but your account and any owned games will be unaffected. 5. Click on your preferred referral link. All links give identical benefits and there is no particular reason to choose one over another. If you live outside the USA then you will also have to add your referrer. I cant help with that process as I am not very familiar with it. 6. Power on your Quest and run through the device setup process including setting your phone up with the Oculus app and linking them. 7. After youre done you should receive a notification that you got the $30 store credit.

Valve has had outside companies make ports of/spin offs of their games in the past... [Half Life Opposing Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force) and the sequel [Half Life Blue Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Blue_Shift) was made by Gearbox. They also ported HL1 to Dreamcast...  There are plenty of other console ports of HL2 and other spin offs in Valves past done by 3rd parties.  That being said I think you forget just how much history Valve working with hobbyists teams. Sometimes they hire these teams (Portal Counterstrike Team Fortress etc) but other times they work with them (like give them access to source code) to turn them into commercial products. Look at [Black Mesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_\(video_game\)) for example. Hell [Garys Mod 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod) is being built on the Source 2 engine and nothing outside of HLA has used that yet.

Huge improvement in fps on everything. American truck sim was definitely a bit more challenging to get looking good in VR. Virtual Desktop was the way to go by far. I just could not get it working well with AirLink - very pixelated. However using Virtual Desktop with Ultra settings looks fantastic. No jitter with me. There is definitely a slight performance difference between the 6800 and 6800XT but should still work pretty well. In VD I set resolution to Ultra sharpness to 90% and bitrate to 120 MBps in VD. THis looks so much better than even Oculus Link wired. Yes the bitrate of 120 is kinda high but see my other post on this thread about maximizing bitrate. Many jitters come not from the card but poor networking setup. 120 MBps should be no problem via Wifi once you clean up your wifi setup.','i576zs1','/r/OculusQuest/comments/tec7ca/quest_2_and_amd_gpus_6800_xt_looking_for_new/i5840bk/'

Make sure you sign into the same Facebook account you accepted the referral with.  Once the initial update/setup is complete you should see a store credit appear in your Oculus account.  Easy as that!  -=-  **NOTE:** You can activate the referral now even if you have not bought your Quest yet. In fact that’s the best thing to do. Also you dont have to buy your Quest from the Oculus site. You can buy it from anywhere but you need to activate my referral link **BEFORE** you setup your new Quest to get the free store credit.   **ALREADY ACTIVATED YOUR QUEST?** If you were eager and have already activated your Quest without a referral (exactly what I did when I first got mine) but it is still within 48 hours of activation you can do a factory reset and still use my referral to get the free store credit. I’ve done it with folks and it works. DM me and I can walk you thru it.  ***BONUS:*** *If you use my referral link  I’ll also share some advice to help you get started and share with you my top tips for new users.*  If you have a question about my instructions please dont hesitate to [send me a DM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=aslamna&subject=Oculus%20Referral&message=) and I’ll be happy to help walk you through the process.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u6f68a/daily_referral_megathread/i589qco/'

Im not really in the loop on the goals of this specific project are for the devs. So if the devs has already expressed they have no interest in ever turning this into a commercial/official release even if Valve made the offer then never could be appropriate.   My personal opinion is if Valve really wanted to port HL2 to VR they would have already done it by now. I suspect they have no interest in such a project but would absolutely be willing to provide some small amount of support if somebody worthy wanted to take on the challenge.

But Ill answer it again Everyone can have an opinion on anything but simply buying the game launching it logging they were in it for less than 5 mins then leaving a negative review with false information such as Long wait times - bots fill the space of players theres less than 60 seconds of wait time to find any lobby Game stole assets from contractors pavlov onward - devs bought licenses to use those assets so nothing was stolen  Then theres some valid negative responses without ill-intent such as not liking the hands not liking the animations not liking the map designs not happy with no immersive reload. All of this is valid criticism and can be worked on and improved.

You have no control about how people feel about the game and what they think its worth to them.

With most straps youre frequently adjusting where they hit on the knuckles either in front of or behind the knuckle line. For example AMVRs top half slides freely along their hairband to really dial in your fit (a real plus) but that free sliding means youll be fiddling with it every time you put on the straps. ProTubes padding is wide enough that it cushions the whole back of your hand so the fit is more forgiving and it should be less likely to drift as you play.

You might try a different port for the link cable since some motherboards have 1 port that can deliver more power to that port. I guess check your motherboard manual to see if thats the case.  If you cant get enough power that way then go wireless and get an external power bank that can deliver at least 2.0Amps of power and that will give you greatly extended play time.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u6lgkc/not_much_playtime_out_of_the_oculus_link/i5917bz/'

You were saying never regarding a Quest port specifically. My comments werent arguing Valve would legitimize a Quest port specifically just that its possible for this PCVR port Dr Beefs team is working on. Dr Beef has a pretty good track record for producing quality VR ports and Valve has a history of rewarding those types of efforts. I can see how you thought I was making that claim though as the initial question you commented on was inquiring about ARM soruce/build of HL2.  All that being said.... I agree a Quest port seems unlikely (especially considering the Dr Beef team appears not interested in the effort involved in porting the engine to mobile) but I still wouldnt say impossible. Yes Valve doesnt release PCVR content outside of Steam (since HL2) but they do port their games to consoles where Steam doesnt exist. So saying Valve wouldnt release an official Quest just because Steam isnt on Quest doesnt really hold water. Id be shocked if Valve didnt do it again with HLA by porting it to PSVR2.','i591ds5','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u5xa2j/upcoming_halflife_2_vr_mod_feels_like_a_modern/i59li1s/'

'i5a7uk9','2022-04-18 18:12:16','AveragePichu','u6rn8x','Cable Problems?','Cabled VR is a mess in general. Sometimes your PC doesn’t like the cable for whatever reason. Sometimes your PC’s fine but the particular USB port doesn’t work for VR. Sometimes your cable is faulty.  Myself I got a $20 USD cable that had 90% 3-5 stars. I was one of the 10% that got one that didn’t work properly. That’s just an inherent risk of buying a third-party cable all of them had a decent chunk of people who got one that just didn’t work right.  My solution was I returned the cable and didn’t buy another one. Used Airlink for a while didn’t like how often it refused to connect upgraded to Virtual Desktop ($20 USD application on the Quest store that’s a third-party Airlink alternative most people find it works better for them). As a bonus I no longer have a cable sticking out of my head. This comes at the cost of streaming performance (theoretically never actually got cabled to work) but it’s good enough and I’ve never had a problem since. I launch Virtual Desktop it connects to my PC without fail I play games with no issues other than the occasional stutter and that stutter’s only because my PC’s not wired to the router.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u6rn8x/cable_problems/i5a7uk9/'

I completely avoided any knowledge of it until I played it and it didnt disappoint. It took me 8 and a half hours to play it the first time through on VR then down to 5 hours and now it is down to 3 hours. Some of the exploits dont work anymore but the mine skip exploit does still work. I mostly dont enjoy VR due to the lack of immersion because all the games available are these polygonal or cartoon style games (including RE4 but it is amazing anyways so it is excluded) instead of graphics like Resident Evil Village (which the Quest 2 can handle using air link) I still enjoy Blade and Sorcery Hard Bullet Phashmaphobia etc I just wish it could be more immersive.

The Quest 2 is not even remotely in the same ballpark as a PC with even a fairly ancient 1070 video card. This headline is misleadingly written by marketers to try to make it sound like the Quest 2 is as capable as a PC when it is anything but.  What this announcement is really telling us is that they just made a game for Quest 2 and ported it to PC.  That being the case I wouldnt expect all the physics of boneworks. The Quest 2 simply isnt capable of doing all those calculations or rendering a detailed environment with lots of stuff to come crashing down when you knock it over. Itll be boneworks lite with some physics objects but mostly the stuff where the player can grab and push enemies and load the guns in funny ways.   Graphically it will be far less impressive.

It does some interesting things but a lot of that hinders you more than helps you. Like climbing a ladder is a chore because its really hard to dismount. And picking an item up off a shelf becomes a chore when you accidentally grab the shelf instead and pull it over.  Also there were so many different movement options and I had no idea what did what so I went with the default and the game was constantly making me motion sick because it both has acceleration on movement which Im not sure if you can disable and it knocks your head around.  As far as the graphics and story go both were merely servicable. Its no Half-Life Alyx thats for sure. The story was simultaneously both confusing and unrewarding even after others disected it and explained how it tied into Duck Season. I kept waiting for some big reveal that never came.

Oculus Developer Hub has that option. Alternatively you can use adb     `adb shell am broadcast -a com.oculus.vrpowermanager.prox_close`      The problem may be caused by the proximity sensor being faulty or its connectors.    The connector on the mainboard has a tendency to become loose as the flex cable is under tension. Later Quest 2 have some tape over it to keep it in place.   Ive also frequently seen water damage on proximity sensors that either destroyed the sensor or its connector.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u6w25i/oculus_quest_proximity_sensor_brokennot_working/i5b290c/'

Theyve delivered a really strong and unique take on the city creation genre (which passed QA certification first time). Theyre already hard at work on free post-launch content too.      The decision was taken independent of what Cities: VR are doing. Two titles in the same genre can coexist quite happily just as they would in the flatscreen space (or already do in the VR space). Were confident Little Cities will be successful no matter when it comes out as its an original take on the genre built from the ground up to make the most of VR. The decision to move the launch day was due to the fact we received information about this week’s activities very recently which meant we had to be reactive.      Little Cities deserves its own launch window. Its been a labour of love for the team at Purple Yonder for the best part of four years originally developed as a hobby project in the evenings around full-time jobs (and look how far it has come since). The game is already 100% complete and plays incredibly well.

This is not the worst thing they have done because it doesnt affect everyone.  Since you are doing PCVR I really recommend blocking updates. Just go into your routers parental settings and whitelist a random non-facebook website like google.com and make it only apply to your Quest. **Your Quest can still use Airlink/Virtual Desktop with this** at least on a TP-link routers some routers might block more.

Best bet is to find a subreddit or discord server for those and look for players.

We are sorry to hear youre your Link experience is not optimal.   - First make sure the headset works properly when used as a stand-alone device i.e. without the use of the Link cable  - Also check that the Air Link feature is not activated at the same time as the connected cable. Indeed if the Air Link feature is activated as well as the connected link it will generate a conflict between both of them -Try to play if you have the possibility with another PC which is of course compatible or with another headset. This would be very helpful for the diagnosis - Try if you can with another cable ? - Check that the cable is not damaged - Make sure you PC is compatible with [Oculus link requirements](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/oculus-link-compatibility/?locale=en_en)  Here are some additional optimizations we invite you to make in order to try to restore the situation:  - Please now connect a monitor keyboard and mouse only to your computer (no other devices at this time). - Disable as much software and app as you dont use during this test period. - Please disable your real-time antivirus scanning during this test period. - Please check your available storage space on your PC. - [Try another Windows user account with administrator permissions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-20de74e0-ac7f-3502-a866-32915af2a34d)  If there steps dont resolve the issue regarding your right controller please contact our [Support team](https://support.oculus.com/articles/contact-us/contact-us/index-contact-us). Theyll be happy to help you further. Feel free to attach a screenshot of a potential error message to your message.  Finally in order to save time please also check beforehand that your graphics card is up to date. It may be that it does not fit (or not anymore) in the minimum configuration or that the drivers are not up to date.

In Elixir for example you make a triangle with both your hands index  fingers and thumbs and look through it to aim. Then you drop your hands and teleport to where you were aiming. After some practice its pretty fast and intuitive. And combined with roomscale support its pretty functional. But yeah theres only so much you can do compared to a controller. But then you can make in-VR controllers that your virtual hands can use. For example in No Mans Sky (doesnt support hand tracking) to fly a ship you grab a virtual flight stick with your virtual hands and that lets you control the ship you dont do it with thumbstick (roll is still on thumbstick though).

All you have to do is click the link to accept the referral BEFORE you turn on the Oculus device and you’ll automatically receive the store credit shortly after you finish setting up the Oculus. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!  https://www.oculus.com/referrals/link/Royboy9/  I’m also available for you to ask ANY questions including game recommendations technical questions or anything else since I’ve done a ton of research the last couple months. Message me anytime!  For anyone that already activated their device before accepting a referral code you can follow the steps below to reset your device and accept a referral code to receive the $30. I just did this and it worked for me right away. Note that this doesnt remove any games you already bought (I still see the one game I bought after doing this).

The headset has an internal battery you don’t change out. You charge it with a USB-C (I think) cable.      What you can do is get one of those battery packs people use to charge their phone on the go. Not to heavy and if you have a way to attach it to the back of the headset (the strap part) I hear that it evens out the weight of the headset nicely.     So you could have multiple battery packs and keep changing them as they die out.  I think the headset might pull more power they they put in but it would change it from 2 hours to up to maybe 10 (assuming 5 battery packs).      Also I didn’t run any numbers.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u7zc41/how_long_does_it_take_o_charge_an_oculus_and_how/i5i5rkf/'

Some of those titles look so impressively immersive and I think Meta did a great job in putting their developer partnerships forward.  Overall good event. Lots to be excited for.  As for specifics I dont think I saw anything quite rivaling something like RE4. The NFL game looks okay and probably will help with getting out of the nerd audience (which is clearly metas approach given some of their TV ads). Red matter looked pretty cool.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u7xkt5/meta_gaming_showcase_megathread/i5i98vq/'

Unfortunately VRs not picked up as much traction yet as people were hoping. Yeah a tonne of people bought the Quest 2 but the Quest 2 isnt allowing for the kind of game-changing experience that Alyx provides and not everyone has a PC that they can Link to.      I think VR still has many years left in its infancy. Hopefully whatever Sony is doing with its PSVR 2 will push things forward a bit and encourage some cross platform games to get made but I think were just going to see companies double down on retaining exclusives to their respective platforms/HMDs. Thatll only further kill any chance that VR might have of taking off in the long run.','i5iah8h','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5ib3j6/'

Seriously you can go to Walmart or any Hobby store and get a good little start up Acrylic paint set for 25 dollars.. they are little tubes but will last longer than you think..   Or.. If you can learn how to mix colors good in VR then you can do what I do and just go with Black White and then the 3 primary colors ( Vermillion actually HAS this as a palette option ) .. That way you can get bigger tubes of real paint that will last you longer.    Brushes.. Walmart.. $5.00 gets you an assortment + 2 plastic painting knives/palette knives.  Canvases - Dollar Tree believe it or not.. They are small but perfect for beginners.. 1.00 or 1.25 each depending on your store.    Do not start with oil paints.. i cannot stress this enough.. they are messy and expensive.. and use a lot of chemicals.  Acrylics clean up with water.. but they dry fast too..

Look nobody is going to buy an expensive VR headset when theres nothing to play on it but shovelware and short tiny shallow games or ports of ancient stuff. When Sony releases a new console they release it with amazing games. When Nintendo released Switch they released it with amazing games and ported many amazing ones over (Witcher 3 Dying Light Doom (2016) Divinity etc). Oculus hasnt done any of this when releasing Quest 2. So what is my motivation to buy Camrbria or Quest 3? Why would I buy next hardware when theres still no decent software to play on it? And what is available tends to be grotesquely overpriced compared to PC equivalents.  I said this a year or maybe even two ago that if this keeps up VR has a real potential of fizzling out. We NEED some good meaty titles. A 3-5 hour game with zero replay value a few times a year isnt going to cut it. You cant expect to keep selling hardware when theres no decent software to run on it.  Currently Quest 2 is slated to be my last VR headset. Im not buying anything more until theres some actual decent games for VR. And Im not the only one. I know several people whose VR headsets are collecting dust. My entire circle of friends right now is almost exclusively playing one of three things: Dying Light 2 Total War: Warhammer 3 or Elden Ring. Almost nobody is playing VR in any serious capacity. Because theres not much to play. What there is that is decent has been milked to death already. And aside from a few half-finished short shallow repetitive derivative indies theres not much out there. Best VR games continue to be ports from PC but even those are few and far apart.  Its a serious serious problem. I can feel myself losing interest in VR. Playing less and less every quarter.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5idskb/'

I dont care for pointless bones or ragdolls physics sims but TWD Retribution Espire 2 Moss 2 and Red Matter 2 are very welcome sequels that look positively better than the original games in every way.  The official NFL game looks impressive enough though not my kind of game.  And last but not least that Ghostbusters VR game in co-op is gonna rock hard...  so no GTA SA no Splinter Cell nor AC nor Deep Silver nor dreamy ports of Bioshock and Morrowind... this I expected.

Kind of no big deal if u ask me','The total time (around 25 min) was almost the same as last year too. I want to see *more* progress and more AAA this year compared to last year because the Quest 2 sold like crazy two Holidays in a row. Arguably there was NO AAA shown (Saints & Sinners could be seen as an AA game). Mercenaries is an add-on.  Even if they dont have gameplay ready at least give us a release window for GTA Splinter Cell and AC? Show a plain title card or concept art but give us some idea when its coming out. As Nathie the Youtuber said we gamers feel better when you give us a roadmap of where youre going. Leaving us waiting with these long VR droughts is not fun in the long run. Since theyve been quiet so long I honestly have no idea if Splinter Cell/AC is 2023 2024 or *possible VR vaporware.*  And even though its a gaming showcase they couldve shown more things outside of gaming. VR can do VR180 documentaries videos concerts Quill animations social apps. Show some upcoming projects there too.   I dunno I feel like 2022 was supposed to be a much bigger improvement over 2021 but it didnt really feel like it. Better than last year? Yes but not hugely so. Now I feel like were back in the dark waiting a long time for games just like before.

Thanks for the question modding is not directly supported on the Quest 2 at this moment in time. Another issue that comes with modding is the risk that it will lead to an unstable frame rate that will cause players to experience motion sickness. We are working incredibly hard to ensure Cities: VR runs at a stable FPS throughout the experience. That being said we will continue to support Cities: VR post launch with FREE content updates feature improvements & bug-fixes (this could even be implementing a mod typically used in Cities: Skylines into Cities: VR if the demand is high enough)','i5ibatu','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81zq4/cities_vr_ama_chance_to_win_cities_vr_game_keys/i5ifdqe/'

'i5ifhfb','2022-04-20 11:11:06','honestbleeps','u7xkt5','Meta Gaming Showcase Megathread','while its a bummer to see such recent hardware lose support so quickly theres really two sides to this coin...  maintaining backward compatibility is expensive. it requires various techniques that may include storing 2 sets of assets for things or just dumbing down the games graphics/performance altogether for the weaker of the 2 headsets etc...  so basically supporting the older slower hardware is not only more expensive (more work) but also may mean hindering forward progress on utilizing new hardware to the best of its abilities.  This is just a reality that people will need to live with in terms of having self contained hardware that isnt upgradeable in the way a PC is. Im not saying its a happy reality and Im not saying I dont have sympathy for those who bought a Q1 and dont want to / cant afford to upgrade to a Q2 (or Q3 or whatever comes next) -- its just a much more complicated issue than painting the game devs meta or whoever else as bad guys.  I would think that in the next generation or two well hit a plateau where improvements are a bit more marginal since theres only so much physical size/space/heat constraints to work within and then we wont see hardware refreshes as often and this becomes less of a problem. Alas in the early days of the tech this is just the reality.','i5ib92p','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u7xkt5/meta_gaming_showcase_megathread/i5ifhfb/'

I have no idea what I should expect and I dont know what games are hi-fidelity and what are not. I just hear of a game people are talking about and want to try it out.

I can understand how frustrating it must be for the refresh setting to be locked like it is at 72hz and Ill be happy to assist further with this.   From having reviewed other tickets and Oculus Forum posts it appears youre not the only one who has reported that the refresh rate after the recent update is locked at 72Hz. I havent heard of anything that would indicate that this was intended so what I will be doing for you (Me) is reaching out to our internal team about this so that they are made aware of this and to see if they can get it resolved.  As I know a lot of people find the ability to adjust the refresh rate of the device to be quite useful.   I do not currently have any ETA on a resolution at this time however I will let you know once I have an update from them.  I ask that you please allow me sometime as it may take a few weeks before I hear anything back at the latest.   Do let me know however if you have any other questions or concerns that I can assist you with in the meantime.   Thank you   Damn a few WEEKS just to HEAR BACK from them not a few weeks to get it fixed a few weeks to hear back. Lord what is this team made of? Didnt Facebook put like a shit ton of cash into this VR thing?

Kind of no big deal if u ask me','For a spring announcement I thought this was decent.  Something for everyone.  You probably werent the audience they were looking at.  My biggest hope was Please some different kinds of games different genres and not all zombie survival horror.  And it delivered.  Weve got great sequels to currently great games like TWD Red Matter and Moss.  Personally Im hyped as hell about RUINSMAGUS.  Bonelab looks great.  Cities looks like Cities.  But youre forgetting the biggest draw.  The one thats going to blow up.  No - not Amogus.  Not Ghostbusters.  But closer.  Friggin NFL.  I get it.  Were gamers.  Were redditors.  Were gaming redditors who hover on here to see what other people write about the games we obsess all over are.  But... were like 10% of the total population of people who got a Quest 2.  Were important because were the enthusiasts but enthusiasts alone cant support a brand.  Pop a Quest 2 on top of Dad and Uncle Chuck and let them be quarterback leading the Packers or Cowboys or 49ers or whoever else and I swear youll have fantasy football leagues reliving their glory days back when they were in high school.  Youll have grown men in tears.  This has the physical activity and actions of the actual sports combined with the strategy of console sports titles.  I thought it looked killer.  Its not for me sure.  I wanna play the JRPG ARPG.  But its for the masses.  And thats what this presentation needs to be.  Besides.  Its a coming up very soon presentation.  Youre going to get whats coming up soon with a few things further out.  But you never get the biggest titles announced in spring.  Summer at the earliest.  If you drop the bomb too early then it gets drowned out by everything going in in the summer and hype dies down.  So youre just not going to see Assassins Creed or Bioshock or whatever else.  Its just \*not happening\* right now.  But for spring this was enough.  Lastly.  Were not going to get some games.  Anything involving Microsoft - Minecraft Skyrim Fallout - just isnt going to happen for the Quest 2.  Minecraft isnt going to make another special version if it cant run Bedrock its not going on Quest 2.  And those other games... theyre just too massive.  Microsoft is done downgrading their stuff to meet minimum requirements for other platforms thats what XCloud is for.  The sooner some of yall can stop pinning your hopes and dreams of playing Skyrim on Quest 2 without a PC the happier youll be.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5iki2m/'

VR design practices are still being developed through all kinds of trial and error many many game mechanics working in pancake games. And game rhythms would also be totally different massively impact the game development. Old experiences from working on pancake games wont help you that much anymore. So games like GTA or splinter cell wont be that fast since these games implemented many complex interactions that would be tricky to recreate in VR and these problems wont be solved by money or any kind of brute force. Id suggest pray to the God of Inspiration to strike more VR designers would do a better job than complain here.😅 And this is only the design side of things.   But yeah I agree with other types of showcase not necessarily only games. But I also understand they originally position Quest as a gaming console unlike Go or Rift and there is a company inertia to keep it so oppose to make it a general computing device. And I suspect they would now use Quest Pro(wont use this name also) line to fill the gap further differentiate it from the Quest line from the marketing standpoint.  Dont put your hope on a specific year. Every year has its own things and moments. If you want some confidence just look at their dedication from their expenses on VR and Zuckerbergs personal commitment in VR(no other CEO spent as much time as him on XR hes been on connect in recent years and now even in a smallish game showcase show) to all kinds of crazy company buyouts and their research papers on VR you know how much chips theyve put on the table.

I found it to be really beautiful they put a lot of work in high resolution and detailed texture work that brought the game to life. The battle system wasnt great though but it was serviceable.  By comparison Alyx blew AW out of the water in terms of overall experience. Alyx had the story the graphics the gameplay the music the ambiance... and it put all of these into one really amazing package.  Over the past few years Alyx remains one of my most memorable gaming experiences one that I wish I could experience for the first time again and again. Im waiting a few years before reloading it and giving it another go so that I can come back to it fresh - but yeah its hard to go back to any other VR game after Alyx they just dont stack up and you feel like youre playing tech demos rather than fleshed out games.  The only other game that I enjoyed as much as Alyx was Skyrim VR. I modded the hell out of that thing and when I was done with it it looked and played incredibly. The modding community turned a mediocre experience into something that felt like it was built from the ground up for VR.  Unfortunately my Index hasnt seen the light of day for some time now... after Alyx I kept it around but never felt drawn towards any other VR games out there.

It’s no big issue anyway as quest 1 users can just sideload the games and still play if developers don’t want their money that’s not their fault doesn’t stop them from playing the games just fine. Resident evil 4 Vr is a rock solid 72 fps on quest 1.   Power is obviously not the reason for meta to abandoned quest 1. they do also abandoned rift and rift s which are most far more powerful than quest 2. Userbase on quest 2 is just so much bigger that they don’t care about the Rest anymore which will likely happen again once quest 3 drops.

Kind of no big deal if u ask me','Im a huge fan of VR and the potential it has for gaming and I agree with most everything you said.   I get that its a catch 22.  No AAA devs want to invest $ into a game that has the small userbase VR has.  At the same time I feel that VR is at risk of fading away if it doesnt get these types of games.  This is a tough issue to solve and I honestly dont have an answer on how they can fix this.  I think back to a few years ago when some of the original Oculus founders left when facebook decided to go the cheaper Quest mobile headset route vs high end more expensive route.  Part of me agreed with them and at the same time I see what Facebook was trying to do.  Cheaper headsets mean more people will buy but who is going to use them on the regular when the content kinda sucks.  Whos is going to pick up the next Gen Meta headset when the first one sat around not being used due to lack of content?  If you go the more expensive route like they did with the original Rift you have some pretty compelling content in my opinion but you dont sell a lot because its too expensive and requires a gaming pc on top of that.  More people I know have a Quest than ever had a Rift but they use it for a while then never touch it.  Thats a really bad sign.  For high end VR gaming in the near future the only company I have hope in currently is Sony.  I feel like PSVR 2 may be a do or die moment for quality VR gaming depending on what content they have for it.   I wouldnt be suprised if Meta and Apple just end up fighting it out over business use VR applications.  When it comes to gaming content I feel like Meta just doesnt get it.  By the way I hope I am wrong on all of this. I love VR and want it to succeed but every year I see new announcements and feel like I am stuck in 2016 when Oculus and Vive launched.  Im not getting a sense of progress on the software side of things.','i5idskb','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5ixmov/'

Delaying the week actually turned me away from the game because it exposed the differences between the two cities builders.','i5iry2w','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5j013z/'

Its not Oculus anymore. Its Meta Quest.  2. PCVR games ARE Quest games. You can play them on Quest. Case closed. Just because you cant doesnt mean they arent. Are PSVR games not Playstation games because some people dont have the add-on? NO.  Someone makes this post every other day...its not groundbreaking and its not going to change anything because a few people salty they dont have a PC are whining about it. And the sub is hardly flooded with posts. I started as Quest standalone and it never bothered me.  Id gather its the same people crying over PCVR that are the ones flooding the board with the same questions that have been asked a million times several times a day and ACTUALLY flooding the boards.','i5iy3ph','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u7nxkv/i_feel_like_when_people_post_games_on_here_you/i5j04i1/'

Not good enough for you? Well send me a DM to verify your name after using my link and activating your headset and Ill gift you up to $15 of GAME of your choosing as my way of saying thanks. Just let me know what you want and Ill send it your way. Please also mention that you found my link through this post. If you see this comment and decide to use my referral then thank you very very much. If not then thanks anyways.   As the thread says make sure that you use this link **BEFORE** activating your headset. If you need more detailed instructions please dont hesitate to send me a message and Id be happy to help walk you through the process.  Feel free to also message me directly if you run into any unrelated issues or have any questions. Im always happy to help! This referral link is for new users in the USA.  ***  # Already activated your Quest?  Not a problem! If less than 48 hours have passed then you should still be able to get that store credit by following these steps (Some people have been able to do it within seven days but this doesnt appear to work consistently in that case.): 1. Go to the following link and select Delete Device Data: https://secure.oculus.com/my/devices/ 2. Perform a factory reset on your actual Quest by powering it off and then pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time for several seconds. You should see a boot menu appear on screen. You can navigate this menu with the volume buttons and use the power button to select the highlighted option. 3. Select the Factory Reset option and then yes to confirm that you want to reset your device. 4. The device will guide you through a short reset process. All data on the headset will be lost but your account and any owned games will be unaffected. 5. Click on your preferred referral link. All links give identical benefits and there is no particular reason to choose one over another. If you live outside the USA then you will also have to add your referrer. I cant help with that process as I am not very familiar with it. 6. Power on your Quest and run through the device setup process including setting your phone up with the Oculus app and linking them. 7. After youre done you should receive a notification that you got the $30 store credit. It may take a few minutes to arrive and you can check at this location: https://secure.oculus.com/my/payment-methods/ Store credit should be listed at the top of the page. Alternatively you can check on the app by tapping your picture in the top left and selecting Payment Methods in the menu that appears.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u7yh89/daily_referral_megathread/i5j2d0d/'

VR gaming is still extremely niche.  PSVR was the big dog at the moment in terms of sales but then Quest 2 blew it out of the water.  But Sonys main push is and always has been the PS5 they want PSVR2 to succeed as a secondary thing on top of that.  This is a market where if one guy wins we all win.  The more people adopt SOME type of VR the more people VR grows in general.  So Sonys plan is probably have GhostBusters come out first on Quest 2 get the multiplayer down get the bugs worked out THEN bring out an enhanced full version to PSVR later assuming it wasnt a total dud of a title.','i5iqrir','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5jatcb/'

I honestly prefer native quest graphics sure it’s lower texture quality but all the edges are solid and nothing is watery.

I didnt walk into Quest 2 expecting miracles I assumed that unless a game was hyper-stylized that I should expect something more arcade-y or minigame-ish and I havent been disappointed.  I think of VR being on a sliding scale of quality and accessibility and obviously the Q2 leans harder on accessibility.  Im sorry but if youre expecting PCVR quality games you shouldnt walk into a Meta gaming showcase with high expectations -at all-.  That being said Ive seen some amazing things on Q2 that I hadnt been expecting and it all comes down to whether the dev is good at optimizing their game and leaning on an art style rather than trying to achieve realism.  I dont see what you said as a problem.  Again I didnt expect much from this showcase.  Its mid-April theyre going to give updates a shadowdrop or two some new surprises and not much else.  And theyre just getting their toes wet as a gaming company I dont expect the world.','i5j6fof','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/i5jbthv/'

Kind of no big deal if u ask me','I actually support their decision to come after. Cities skylines VR is a port. Plain and simple its a port. Theyre planning for their game to do better because it  runs better and looks better because it was built from the ground up for VR. I believe when skylines comes out its going to flop and with them holding back all those players are going to go straight to them on their release. They have more time to build hype and show off their game. Its a good business move and that cannot be denied. They will have all those disappointed players that love city builders flocking to their game. Me myself is not even shooting for skylines because its going to be an inferior game. No port ever has lived up to expectations especially pulling to VR like quest. Its totally different its mobile hardware so things like the quest had said the go headset are all going to lag more than a PC headset. Thats going to push away a lot of players.

Infected blood?','Its on itch.io instead of having to plug your quest into your computer every single time you want to adjust something you only have to plug it in once turn on wireless ADB using either sidequest or the Oculus Development Hub then you can do absolutely everything on the quest itself.. not only that but there are hundreds of profiles made specifically for essentially every popular game. But the real attraction of the app for me and the reason I got it is because you can make your own custom profiles. Ive found that all of the cloud profiles *do* offer quality and performance increases but for some games you can actually crank the resolution up a bit higher than they recommend. You can experiment all you want and figure everything out. Worst case the game just lags really.hard or crashes then you know to just increase the performance or lower the resolution if performance is already maxed lol  https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer  Used to be $2 but Im guessing he saw how many people were actually interested in it so he jumped and doubled the price lmao.

That’s two different levels and it’s already amazing the quest can do what it does on its own. It’s simple the more powerful a system is the more things can be run on it. How are you going to compare a headset that will definitely cost more then the quest plus it needs a 500 dollar console with a 300$ standalone headset.

Kind of no big deal if u ask me','if you have to put things into classifications like that then yeah it all is.  The big companies that can build incredibly massive content games do not have enough incentive to come and play and also the portable VR market has only existed for about.. 2 years now.  And the gestation time for a flat-screen AAA game is usually much longer than that.    The Indie studios that are putting all their eggs in VR are the big winners right now and theyre going to continue pushing out as fast as they can iterating on what theyve done before before the big boys come in if ever.  That said at least TWD is infinitely playable even if it does peter out after the storyline is over.  It gives enough stuff for people to do that there are plenty of players who have hundreds of ingame days in it.

That is probably the biggest reason for them to iterate quickly hence why were seeing so many Quest 2 only games coming out now. Its quite abit better and still is a top tier VR optimized SoC. The controllers are a vast improvement over the Q1 controllers they had big production issues sourcing the materials for the Q1 too specifically the fabrics. Q1was heavier like you mentioned its got a higher resolution display (worse is subjective for the trade offs) and $100 less expensive. Thats kind of many no?  They had to make a better easier to produce headet once they knew what they had was going somewhere. Now that they have that product Itll be less of a rush now as were already seeing. Theyve said that this will have a long life cycle.','i5jlqa6','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u85yj5/is_the_quest_1_starting_to_get_obsolete/i5jn29v/'

Weve really really taken a step back in AI since 2001.  also as others point out distinction between not AAA and AAA is usually more along the lines of something having had a lot of resources (ie capital / money) spent on it to create.  And theres no real hard line to it.  A well known studio will usually throw shit tons of money to build something and itll have a lot of human resources applied to it.  The credits roll for S&S is insanely long for a studio that is as small as they are but probably the entire staff of the company (including their parent company) as well as the staff of every company that they worked with to put it all together is included.

I dont know how many of people there owns a quest too but we cant never get enough fpv simulators haha.     I have a radio transmitter myself and learned to flight on simulators. But ended up buying a quest 2 instead of fpv googles a drone batteries a charger a special box to keep the batteries. It was a choice of expending almost the same amount of money but living in a city I know that I just wouldnt fly the drone enough time to feel that it was money well expended.   And also I would need to constantly buy replacements for the drone batteries and stuff that breaks with every crash.     Long story short this is exactly what I was looking for since I bought the quest2.    Im buying it on steam right know','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/tzt9gd/dvr_simulator_fpv_drone_simulator_oculus_quest/i5rv6yc/'

If you dont mind I have a couple other questions.  > These numbers are they:  >    1. NOT just the sustained data rate of the cable  >    2. BUT the rate of VIDEO bandwidth you are able to steam to the HMD?   Ive been measuring actual USB interface throughput during Link use. Theres an outline of the methodology used for that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/nc2x08/oculus_quest_2_only_supports_about_250mbps_on/gy2twmy/      > I noticed I felt an increase in perception of depth and color on my rift s VS my quest 2 on Virtual Desktop.     I have a Rift S as well and would say the same thing. No matter how much you optimize Link or even how much you chase clarity at the expense of everything else Rift S still gives you a cleaner and crisper experience. Sometimes just to a subtle degree and sometimes to a _significant_ degree.     > Do you use a cable AND WiFi and is there a high enough perceived difference in visual fidelity to care about buying the cable?     Its hard to speak definitively on what is a somewhat subjective topic. Visual acuity/discernment expectation tolerances/sensibilities content choices etc all obviously feed into this consideration. GPU choices too. But for me personally there are absolutely situations in which the higher bitrates available over wired make enough of a visual difference to justify the bother of being tethered over USB. On the other hand there are plenty of people here who say that they cant tell the difference between Air Link and wired Link at all even with wired Link configured optimally (so they claim) some even going so far as to insist that anyone who says that they _can_ tell the difference is merely experiencing a placebo effect or isnt actually seeing optimal Air Link performance.

Sure you could turn your heating on etc. in VR but its overkill when you can just lift the headset up and walk over there and hit the dial.  You could have it work with a doorbell camera i guess and receive a popup like how you would a text so you could see the feed in a little box but again kinda pointless because youd still need to leave your game or whatever to go open it.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u9eo2s/vr_interacting_with_domotic_devices/i5s21x2/'

Its pretty easy to pick up and surprisingly deep kind of like a VR version of the early combat flight sims in the 90s and I keep coming back to it.  I see quite a few puzzle games on there and **The Room VR** is the best one Ive played so definitely check that out its worth the price of admission. Its not long-lasting but a great game.  **Population One** has been my best multiplayer experience in VR by a long shot (much better than Onward on Quest).  Do you have a girlfriend/boyfriend? Do they have a Quest? Then **VR Fishing Eleven Table Tennis** and **Walkabout Mini Golf** are solid gold for VR dates and are amazing multiplayer experiences with strangers.

When I just started to use my headset i remembered more dreams than before and they were more vivid but it was as usual when I get excited about something and think about it a lot. It normalised as I got used to using VR in my weekly/monthly routine. However not on daily basis but non the less more often than before in my dreams I doubt the reality. I think it is the direct influence of using VR to be more aware of your perception and the fact that it might be affected. Id say that my brain developed a program running in the background checking if all the information from all sences is coherent.  Just today I noticed another difference in my dreams. Before using VR the view was more or less static and set upright - like a camera in a movie. Since I got used to using VR the view more often is set in my eyes not in some camera. It moves as I move wobbles when I run turns sideways when I turn my head while laying down etc.','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u9laz8/does_vr_affect_your_dreams/i5satch/'

Performance shouldnt be too big of an issue since the emulator would essentially be doing ARM to ARM translation on a comparatively more powerful ARM processor (and has been done before on less powerful systems such as DS emulation on the Vita).  The Quest also supports Vulkan which has shown increases in performance over OpenGL so emulators supporting Vulkan may also have decent playable graphics performance too.  I havent tried it myself since I have native hardware for those devices but the hardware lends itself heavily to the possibility of NDS emulator and Citra ports.','i5q9hfa','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u9a6ce/3ds_pokémon_roms_or_emulators_for_the_quest/i5sh8xt/'

Good luck to you!🥰','I think what I find interesting in my VR experience is the fact that I can despite my impaired vision enjoy VR like any normal person. I mostly like to hang out with strangers in VR Chat and relax in some of the calm beach worlds or play Gun Raiders.  I main the Oculus Quest 2 and it is one of the best things I have ever used. I like that it is a stand-alone VR so I dont have to spend more than $1000 for a decent PC. I got my Quest 2 on christmas day and I started using it and I loved it. It was such a weird feeling putting on the VR for the first time and experiencing it. I managed to get my whole family to try out the VR including my grandparents and they absolutely loved it!','-','/r/OculusQuest/comments/u9m5hh/kiwi_design_accessories_giveaway_comment_on/i5slko5/'

Stalker sounds creepy… def not that.  I don’t want to take control of a car or person. It’s just that if you click on a car or person the overhead camera will follow them. At least in Skylines it does.   All I’m proposing is maybe a first-person or even third-person camera option instead of the standard overhead cam.   That way you can really see the City like a human and not God. I know city planners use Skylines to get an idea for how new projects would pan out.
