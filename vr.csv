Theres a good reason no one uses them for ar (afaik please give some examples me if Im wrong would love to see how its being used). I would focus on the easiest option download unity with AR foundation use the templates and follow some tutorials.

Took me a few weeks to get a prototype up but the Unity Learn site plus the templates have everything you need. Also Imphenzia on YouTube has my favorite general Unity tutorial.

Were constantly reducing the complex abstract activities in our minds to things we can do through our existing interfaces which feel very 2-dimensional in general ( think phones and laptop screens ). For the kind of things you probably do every day you will not need AR or VR but once you realize how you could do drastically new things more intuitively because the medium has now suddenly become more immersive free and blended with our experience of physical reality its hard to go back. Its difficult to explain but think about this when folks were building micro/personal computers back in the 60s no one was thinking about building them so we can have things like Netflix or Amazon or Facebook','i5brsbv','/r/augmentedreality/comments/u6x4om/the_present_and_future_of_ar/i5dhy4c/'

The camera and LiDAR view a small consistent space. Then real consistently sized/patterned objects within that space can be moved.   The augmented reality aspect of it would be to overlay an animated graphic on the real objects that moves with them. Once one of those items reaches a defined space the graphic turns off.   Example: two circles at the far end of the defined space - one overlayed with red the other blue. The scattered small real objects in the foreground sparkle red or blue. Then the real objects are moved to their color circle.   (Hope that makes sense. Hard to articulate)','i5jjxwp','/r/augmentedreality/comments/u7wt49/etiquette_for_hiring_an_ar_developer/i5joxjx/'

You can add some AI features to your app. For example conversational AI will help you create a virtual assistant who can not only show the sights but also talk about them.

Can you build something that integrates with their existing apps or provides a whitelabel app solution for them?  The challenge may be that many of these are focused on “nights stayed”. If they can increase the number of nights tourists stay then that puts more money into local businesses while still allowing market forces to work regarding which operators thrive and which fail. Your app improves the experience of tourists but does it make them want to visit and/or stay longer?  Municipalities and local councils may also have an interest for locals not tourists. This would be a similar conversation but with more focus on helping residents explore their town (and possibly spend some money on local businesses while doing it).  Depending on your commercial vision you could perhaps sell 100 regions / towns an app for $X0000 upfront and $X00/month. VC money wants you to sell 100x those numbers but that could perhaps be possible - hence doing the market research!','-','/r/augmentedreality/comments/u8j6gj/how_to_elegantly_create_a_financiallysustainable/i5og7yy/'

I love the term democratization of AR. I even mention you in my classes when I talk about ARs own paradigm shift from premium coders to casual creators. Besides my thesis student used geocast for her project.  I believe using a platform or a custom solution wont influence the long-term monetization factor much it might affect the initialization costs but not the 5-year plan. AR projects need to find a way to ensure lasting profitability especially when we crave that ARs journey is **not** a pretty featurette or a supporting technology.

But its interesting to think of this underlying question: will the person involved be happy or unhappy about whats actually happening?  The emperor might have felt fooled because he paid for something that only he could see his expectations were different. But what if theres clarity about who can see what? Lets take into account that the amount of people being able to view things going on in this realm is going to increase with the arrival of AR glasses. Furthermore its important to realise that these AR wearable creations are not necessarily expensive purchases  you can easily make them yourself for free.   A question of a different kind can be: why wear AR when theres a phenomenon called physical fashion which has worked for centuries? Who needs the new possibilities offered by virtual materials?   But isnt it a great advantage of AR that anyone can do anything anywhere without forcing anybody to be part of it to view it to understand it or to appreciate it? We can all live in our personal version of reality and it even goes one step beyond pure imagination.

Im not sure if you can fix the sitting thing.   Into the radius is an open world survival horror game that has a setting for playing while seated. I just started playing the other day Ive only done the tutorial but for the first time I was mind blown by vr. Not because of the mechanics in the game but because of the actual environment.  Theres alien isolation but you have to play via a mod for vr. Also I dont think it supports motion controls so youll have to use a controller (Or keyboard and mouse I suppose is possible).  Theres another game I believe was horror that uses a mod for vr and supports motion controls but I cant remember the name  Edit: just saw that you get sick when moving via joystick. How long have you had vr/been playing vr and have you tried using teleport locomotion or vignetting when moving?','-','/r/VRGaming/comments/u9i2b1/any_vr_horror_games_i_can_play_either_sitting/i5rsc2t/'

I can’t stand the java version small chunk zone loading (more chunks in the settings and the game is too laggy).   I tried the adventure map caves and cliff from a recent update.   I thought at first that I would only be taking a look for a few minutes. I ended playing 3 hours straight and wanting more maps to play on. The sight is gorgeous everywhere with chunks settings to the max and fps is still 90 (beefy pc though). I think I never had such far view distance in a VR game before without lags.   It was nice to just chill in there and I plan on going back in tonight.   Be warned though the bedrock edition VR is far from perfect. Motion controls almost useless and there’s a few stuff not handled properly like the VR camera in cinematics.  Edit : sorry I missed the « free » requirement from your post.

Even games like elite with a good HOTAS setup allows you to snack while you game and with desktop+ or similar you can even watch YouTube or whatever while you play. Its still just not as convenient as just sitting down loading up something slow that you can play at your own place like a turn based strategy game or a city builder or something and watching YouTube on a second monitor while stuffing your face with chips and beer after working all day.  Thats basically what stops me from playing vr more than flatscreen though I do play a lot of vr. Id say I play 70% of the time on flatscreen 30 in vr even though vr games (the good ones) are just way more immersive and entertaining than anything equivalent on flatscreen.','i5vt9ue','/r/VRGaming/comments/ua379e/before_using_vr_i_loved_playing_pc_games_like/i5vyk5c/'

When the 970 was vr ready headsets had a significantly lower resolution and that makes a big difference and even then it was on the lower end of gpus.  It will really struggle powering a recent headset and it wont give you enough fps for a good experience in more hungry games. It might run something like beat saber but dont expect to play hl alyx.   If your budget is low then selling your soul to Facebook and getting a quest 2 might be worth a consideration since it will be a better experience than pcvr on a weak pc plus you can use it as a pc headset.','i392qxj','/r/virtualreality/comments/tvewtx/hey_everyone_is_this_pc_vr_ready_i_dont_care/i396hlk/'

There are many things that can cause disconnections such as not enough power on USB port not enough USB bandwidth and not disabling the integrated graphics. Try switching USB ports and ensure youve disabled the integraded graphics.  The [OpenMR forum](https://community.openmr.ai/) also has troubleshooting guides and a very helpful community.

That card is past the end of its life as its successor the 1070 is nearing the end of its life.  You need to care about what GPU you have for VR. You dont want to just run the bare minimum. You need to keep up with the minimum frame rates (90 FPS) for VR otherwise youre going to have a bad time.

I dont think that is how it works. If you do PCVR you can only sell to Quest users that have a VRReady gaming computer. There are are a lot more Quest owners than PCVR owners and Quest owners actually buy software when it comes out instead of waiting for things to go on sale for 50% off.  PCVR still provides the biggest and best VR experiences but developers have learned that if a game will run on the Q2 it will sell a heck of a lot more than it will on PCVR. All new VR titles that can be shoehorned into the Q2 *(and any future competing MobileVR headsets)* will come to MobileVR first because that is where the money is right now.  PCVR is just not growing very much.

In games where you might need to read instruments like flight sims then cabled is preferred.  And obviously Reverb G2 will be far superior in image quality.  But Quest 2 is fine it wont be worse than the Vive.

I think that the Quest appeals to people who have consoles in that it fits their mindset. It is designed to appeal to those who appreciate mass market products that have a relatively low entry point.  It is appealing to those people primarily though price as it fits into the console/peripheral price range. PSVR will fit in to the PS ecosystem and appeal largely to the same market but provide a better experience at a slightly higher price point.  It will be to console VR what the quest is to PCVR in that it will bring a current gen experience to those players at a reasonable price point.  I think it might win because it will start to be a toss up between that and the quest which people will see at friends’ houses and the PSVR will likely provide a higher fidelity experience.

This 47% statistic doesnt include all the Quest 2 users who never even connected it to Steam (whereas the vast majority of PCVR headsets will have connected to Steam to begin with).  A research firm reported that [about 80% of all VR headsets sold in 2022 were the Quest 2.](https://www.androidcentral.com/quest-2-2021-most-sold)  On top of this the numerous reports from developers/publishers that most of their sales come from Quest its fairly clear the Quest has captured over half of the VR market in terms of both units sales and software profits.  Meta/Facebook might still be operating their VR segment at a loss. Maybe. The Quest 2 is a loss leader after all.

I feel like the argument is a lot more nuanced but its difficult to address this concern properly since we dont have specific data. Unless were relying on the fact that in the Quest store theres never any sales (probably not the case) and this would mean that naturally PCVR users take advantage of favorable prices just because they can.   >PCVR is just not growing very much.

But if you are looking always for the brightest and richest colors of the whole spectrum for e. g. modern art it will not work out as expected currently. There are great artists in the Vermillion community who are professional painters creating amazing pieces of art. So I would disagree that its just aimed at people who are new to painting. The app is just very intuitive to use which opens the door also for beginners like me.','i3jom0d','/r/virtualreality/comments/twr14s/i_learned_to_paint_literally_overnight_in_vr_its/i3k3vg1/'

This is exactly the kind of response I was looking for and more.  I currently have a GTX 1070 that I use with my CV1 on my Windows gaming pc. To give you an idea of the performance Alyx works but is not so smooth. VRChat also gets really really choppy the first minute or so after entering a new room until most of the avatars are downloaded. Most other games work great for me though.  I have also been using Linux as my daily driver for a few years now. Though I am still struggling with a few quirks and concepts. Since I found [Gamehub](https://tkashkin.github.io/projects/gamehub/) a few weeks ago my desire to also run Linux on my gaming machine has strengthen tenfold. I tested a few games on my daily driver pc and so far everything works through Wine and Proton. Amazing.  I also like tinkering so that shouldnt be a problem.  I actually looked for the price of a used Vive 1 a few weeks back but I would really love to have my CV1 work with OpenHMD which would allow me to run it without having to use the Oculus service(?).  Anyway I am quite excited at the prospect of not depending on Microsoft Google Meta and Apple. I really hope Valve doubles down on their Linux efforts especially when it comes to VR. Its really a shame that VR seems to be the only neglected area.','i3h3pk9','/r/virtualreality/comments/twj5kd/how_was_your_experience_with_vr_on_linux/i3k5rtv/'

Thats exactly what it is thats how the XR2 platform works. You buy an SKU and put your software on it.     >Meta does buy their chip from Qualcomm but the quest 2 is a product of their own design.   No it isnt. Thats the whole point of of buying an XR2 product you dont have to do hardware R&D as Qualcomm already does that.    >In addition to that even if what you said was true (and it isn’t) a vr device is a bit more than those components.   They made the cover and built their software on top of android and picked the cams/LEDs and and their tracking algorithm.   Thats it they didnt design any real hardware.  > Edit: do you mean SoC instead of SKU? Your post history suggests you’re not that technically illiterate though so I have no idea what you mean.  Ill never understand why people argue about topics they dont understand.  Qualcomm makes the XR2 SoC but thats not the entire XR2 platform.   The XR2 platform consists of the SoC RAM (up to 8GB) a camera controller (up to 7) supports extra senors to be added options for a 5G radio Support for Foveated rendering and eye tracking and support for displays of 4k@60hz or QHD@144hz.  Thats the platform. Then come SKUs (stock keeping unit).  Qualcomm sells different performance levels of the XR2 platform AKA SKUs ( that term describes any sold product. Example I3/I5/I7 are product lines I7 12900k is an SKU)  A good example is the Quest 2 which isnt even the max XR2 spec. It has 2GBs less RAM than the max and has a slower SoC than the max. It also has less cameras and no 5G.   This was the SKU they bought from Qualcomm.  Please actually look in to these things before telling me Im wrong or trying to insult me.

It does have sim and arcade modes but dont know what they do exactly.  Overload is worth a try just to see how you react. Something about the level design scale or something makes me not get motion sick in that one despite being a crazy 6DOF game (i.e. its  Descent). While something like Aircar which doesnt control all that differently fells pretty bad.   Lone Echo might also qualify as flying but since most of the movement happens by pushing yourself around not propulsion it feels completely different than normal airplane games and I had no motion sickness issues with that.  Generally speaking I think once a game starts moving the horizon around it starts feeling weird. But I cant think of any flying games that allow you to lock the horizon.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/tydruq/looking_for_vr_games_with_good_fly_mechanics_and/i3rwosj/'

Why is it 1.5 years after the Quest 2 that Alyx is still the only AAA game on the system?','> Now some of the stuff you said in general tho does sound like tinfoilery too besides the manipulation stuff. But yeah pretty much the idea as youre saying is to create a new Facebook. Facebook is old and rusty so lets bring this tired and world-damaging shit to VR because perhaps VR on social media means growth again? facepalm  I try to know thine enemy and Facebook is my enemy.  Not just from a VR standpoint but from a social standpoint.  Some of this may sound hyperbolic but I tend to do my research.  Things like this are real:  Personal identifiability of user tracking data during observation of 360-degree VR video https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74486-y  MoviePass Will Track Users’ Eye Movements to Ensure Ad Views https://www.natlawreview.com/article/moviepass-will-track-users-eye-movements-to-ensure-ad-views  People think things like this are fantasy and FB Hating but this stuff is out there and it WILL be used to perpetuate an already very dangerous paradigm.  > How so sure the Quest 2 has its problems but they do feel like (except IPD ugh) theyre minor problems. Also Alyx does show that despite limitations VR can work for traditional entertainment experiences not goofy Wii-style waggle games considering VR usually has more buttons and dont have the weirdness of doing motion controls in the third person. And sales do show that ergonomics while can get a lot better arent the main limitation of the Quest 2 but rather the lack of games.  Quest 2 is the Dollar Store VR headset when it comes to construction (and this was by design).  From the kitchen sink sponge face gasket to why-even-bother head strap to the issue you mentioned - terrible IPD (and FOV when you have 68+ IPD).  The ObamaPhone of VR sure it works.  And if Facebook has their way they would have government cheese lines set up for handing these things out.  Mass adoption requires numbers and this is how they will do it - virtual product dumping.  It has worked for Apple (educational institutions in the 80s) .. it worked for Microsoft (numerous ways).  Now it is working for Facebook.  But my beefs with the Q2 aside VR as a technology is *counter to our existence*.  We are multitasking creatures.  We cant even go sit in a movie theater without breaking out our phone and checking Twitter for Christs sake.  We eat we drink we do other stuff while we game.  VR is complete captivity.  Not comfortable captivity either - regardless of the product.  This is why Facebook wants you **working** in VR ... exercising in VR.  *To normalize it*.  Since youre already strapped in anyway might as well do other stuff while youre there.  VR is not the solution for 99% of what it is being shoehorned into.  IMHO of course.  VR will never be the cell phone.  AR?  ***Maybe*** -- but God willing I wont be alive to see it.  The zombies already walk the streets with their heads buried in their phones.  Families eat dinner together in WhatsApp worlds while sitting at the table.  As you said when IoT is shit and AR will have to take ages to be more than a gimmick.  To become anything more than a gimmick will require a lot more violation of human rights (I could extrapolate but I figure you know what I mean).  The real world(tm) is a distraction from you looking at ads.  I stand by my statement that this is Facebook (and Google ... and will be TikToks and everyone else who is a social media company trying to get into the VR space) ultimate goal.  Captive ad-viewing audience.  > Ill admit I forgot about how VR is like its own divided community from normal gaming and getting a port to VR is not at all like a port to Linux where the latter is a recompile away and the former needs far more than that.  We can easily look at Nintendos failures to understand why VR is a failure for gaming.  Consider disruptions in gaming brought by Nintendo.  You mention wii-waggle but whether you like it or not?  It worked.  Big time.  On the other hand?  Look at the overall failure of paradigm disruptions - like the Wii U.  I wrote several articles about how the personal screen could  be the future of gaming.  But developers couldnt seem to figure it out.  Why bother?  Just do a few updates to the existing shit add some DLC a couple of dances and costumes make a few billion and call it a day.  Wii U could have owned hard.  But it wasnt in the cards.  Even the Nintendo xDS line while popular and had some great first party games ...?  Lost the third party developers.  VR as you say isnt a recompile.  It isnt mapping controls.  Some games (like real life applications) just arent good for the VR platform.  Yet the desire to crowbar this crap into VR seems to be where the focus is.  > as you said squarely depends on Valve and what they do to answer the Quest 2.   When your enemy is essentially putting product into the boxes of childrens cereal as the prize inside and losing $10s of BILLIONS a year?  You dont answer that.  You disrupt it.  You create a segment in parallel.  Valve doesnt give a rats ass about metaverse.  They care about selling games.  Thats what Im interested in buying games playing games.  They are MY horse in this race -- for better or worse.  But unlike some around here I dont consider VR food water or shelter.  I can live without it.  BTW great discussion.

I’d be thoroughly disappointed if alyx was the only reason I got VR.  I also prefer boneworks. It’s just so unapologetically made for vr enthusiasts. Alyx is *amazing* but it does do it’s best to be an easy going experience. Alyx is undoubtedly the better game but I enjoy boneworks so much more. Made by early vr nerds for early vr nerds. Does that make any sense? I’m not even trying to say it’s the better game it’s not. But I just… prefer it? And it’s definitely not for someone who just played their first vr game.  Edit: I think a lot of it has to do with the presence of a body and physics. The fact you can’t melee in alyx still makes me sad. No body collision no inertia no physics interactions with it no joystick loco by default (heck teleport all my homies hate teleport the only reason to use teleport in alyx is because valve is too stubborn to give us a sprint). Of course that’s also part of what gives new players nausea/discomfort.  Fun fact there are fairly credible rumors that valve didn’t add joystick loco till they played the boneworks demo internally. Personally I just love how boneworks feels. To me it is quintessential vr. But that’s just me it will be different for everyone.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/ty65d5/the_best_vr_game_in_the_world/i3s3wos/'

Like it was designed to be as easy/comfortable as possible. Which isn’t a bad thing. But you can tell valve wanted even first time users to have no issues.  Boneworks is unapologetically “vr”. You will get nauseous if you’re not used to joystick loco and involuntary head movements.   But it’s just so much more… free. Wanna climb that shelf? Climb it. That wall? You collide with it. That enemy? Yeah you can bludgeon him to death.   Alyx is visually the prettiest game I have ever played. Story wise it’s very very good.   But as a VR game? Well it’s excellent to. So much more polished. But… boneworks just *feels* better more fun to me.   Shooting something in alyx feels almost empty. In boneworks it’s satisfying.  Edit: That Said I think if I had played alyx first I’d be let down by boneworks too. I think there are only a few of us oddball enthusiasts that played boneworks first in the brief space of time before alyx came out shortly after. And in a way boneworks ruined part of alyx. Alyx is definitely the better game but boneworks is just so… good. To me at least. As a result boneworks almost feels like the hl2 of vr for me the use of physics and collision etc in that game just feels so fun. But I’m not shocked most people prefer alyx. It’s probably the more sane choice.   I am curious though what peoples play times were at the time of trying either. I had over a thousand hours in vr before playing either.','i3ql8zt','/r/virtualreality/comments/ty65d5/the_best_vr_game_in_the_world/i3s65ce/'

With both those devices you are left in no doubt that youre in VR - looks good straight ahead but just black empty space on either side like youre head is enclosed in a black box. The O+ just blows them away with a significantly wider FoV that exponentially raises the sense of immersion. The experience is night and day and resolution refresh rate SDE all that stuff - nothing compared to the impact of a wide FoV.

It has good story fun gameplay beautiful graphics - the traditional metrics of pancake games. But if we look at its utilization of VR - Ive seen better from much smaller studios and even on Quest.  Lets start with most obvious - the weapon wheel. I hate when VR games do it - this is VR! I want to draw weapons by reaching with my hand and grabbing it! And the multitool too - should be in a belt or something. At least the wrist storage feels VR-ish...  Puzzles use the VRs depth perception but thats about it. This is an Half Life game - what happens to physics based puzzles? Operating the machines with your hands is nice but I kind of expected more...  But the worst thing is that you dont feel the presence of the weapons. They are just something you point and shoot not something physical. In Boneworks Id sometimes use a pistol instead of a rifle because its quicker and lighter. In Zero Caliber weapons you dont feel the weapons weight but they do have a collision box so Id often switch to pistol in tight spaces because bigger guns would bump into railings. In HL:A? The only reason to use the pistol is because its easier to find ammo for it...  Now I may be judging HL:A very very strictly here - many other VR games are still good even if they fall short of HL:A in all the things Ive mentioned. But HL:A is being treated as the best VR game the ultimate VR experience and I do feel these shortcomings should prevent it from taking that position.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/ty65d5/the_best_vr_game_in_the_world/i3sa8ec/'

'i3yqz2r','2022-04-08 16:00:04','bushmaster2000','tze3xh','Im having a hard time picking what VR headset is for me','If your priority is clarity then you should look at a dedicated PCVR system.  Reverb G2 is very clear and you have a 3080 to drive it so you should be able to get the best possible outcome the VR game you are playing as to offer.  Other high clarity systems (and high budget) would include Vive Pro2 Pimax 8Kx and Varjo Aero.  If you want clarity you will want a VR system that uses a real video port and doesnt process video to send over a USB cable like the quest does.  But if youre not willing ot pay the big bucks for a high end system your only sub $1000 options are quest 2 and reverb G2.  However Arpara and Lynx are right on the horizon but i dont know clarity wise how good they will stackup to a Reverb G2 or other high-clarity level systems yet as they arent on the market yet.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/tze3xh/im_having_a_hard_time_picking_what_vr_headset_is/i3yqz2r/'

It has one of the best displays for VR at an affordable price and the same comfort and audio as the index.  Tracking range isnt as good as the quest 2 but in my experience it hasnt hindered my experience.  Other considerations are the pimax vive pro 2 or vive focus 3.

I can play games on the quest 2 while connected to this network but it cant get internet I was hoping someone would help me connect the incoming internet on my comp with the ethernet port so the dedicated router could give internet to the headset basically using my comp as the middleman.

You would be able to take your wifi (or ethernet) connection on your PC and mirror that onto a separate wifi or ethernet connection that you connect other devices to.

If you want to do one yourself just find a 3D model of the VR controller and build something around it.  Replacing the controller completely is only possible for Lighthouse tracking and SteamVR. You have the option of using a Vive Tracker or Tundra Tracker and sticking that to your gun or even go completely DIY with the tracking sensors and controller can be bought separably but that requires quite a lot of effort to get working.

Doing your own tracking solution via AR and fiducial maker is possible as well e.g. [see here](https://hackaday.com/2016/08/28/dirt-cheap-vr-gun-with-tracking-for-15-of-added-hardware/).

You can run PCVR on a Mac as long as it is a newer one and you have Windows installed on it.  However in this case it does not sound like OP has the knowledge needed to set all that up and may not have a Mac capable of it. Kinda connects and little wire thingie indicates a need for some learning curve before trying to use PCVR with a Q2 in its current state.  OP it would be good for you to research VR on a Mac and then see what you need to do for PCVR. You can learn the terms and requirements and then ask a question if still needed in a way that enables others to be more helpful. Things for others to know to help are type of Mac what GPU how much RAM what kind of ports etc.  As far as Roblox I believe there is a version for it to use in VR. I dont know if there is a an Android one that can be sideloaded on Quest one or it is just for PC.

Did you speak to the devs about it on discord? Theyre normally pretty forthcoming!  \---**This was a post from one of the devs on the discord (not my words)**\----  Regarding WMR.  I have managed to get hold of a HP Reverb G2 - and I had no problem running Virtuoso. Everything also mapped as expected (the G2 controllers are very much modelled after the Oculus). The motors for haptics are pretty bad and it seems they had some delay also but apart from that it all seems to work (at least for me). It was very much plug and play.  However - Since WMR did not set a standard for controllers though it makes it really hard for us as a tiny developer to support every headset and every controller (which is why we arent officially supporting WMR). Until we eventually would be giving it official support the app should run from SteamVR and the big question is the mapping - either you might get lucky that it just works or you might need to do some manual bindings.  For mapping in SteamVR - (as related to an Oculus controller at time of writing):  Interact One is the Trigger  Interact Two is the Grip  Interact Three is the A/X button - used for playing so it should be comfortably accessible  Dashboard is the B/Y button - should also be easy to get to but less of a priority.  Joystick has a few minor uses but is not crucial.  There is no interactions on the Joystick as a button or the menu button currently.     \----   **And this is a link to the discord if you are struggling still.

Even if VR blows up in the next few years (which it might) you’re still investing primarily in the social media company as the VR division will be taking losses in that time trying to become the dominant platform.    Will they become the dominant platform?   I mean they are right now with the Quest 2. But the Quest 2 also kind-of sucks.  The tech in a VR headset is effectively exactly the same as a cell phone only with some fancy lenses / software / cameras / controllers.  If somebody like Apple entered the game (which they will) it potential changes the entire VR landscape.   The more interesting question is will VR blow up soon….  I actually am not sure (and I love VR).    I think in the next year or two we’ll get almost Varjo Aero type devices from Apple in terms of visual quality.  Only they’ll be standalone devices with M2 chips in them capable of serious gaming.   To me that changes the industry….  But that hypothetical device is also likely to be $2000+ and sold out.   Tough to revolutionize the world overnight with that but it’s a cool starting point.    These VR headsets are probably 1-5 years out from being better screens than any monitor or television that you own.  Like why go to a movie theater when one of these headsets offers a better movie theater experience?   Why fill a spare office with monitors when your VR headset can be 50 monitors in 1 and offer better clarity than anything you could buy commercially.     That’s where we’re headed.   Not there yet.  May be several years until we’re there.  But I’m very excited about it.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u3w5zg/is_this_really_the_future/i541q1u/'

I mainly use Twinmotion which is developed by epic games (same developer as unreal engine) which can import basically any popular modelling software used in architecture (3dsmax archicad vectorworks SketchUp rhino Revit etc.). You can also go from Twinmotion to unreal engine if you need more control of the functionality.

Library sizes Third party programs etc','Just get a Quest2 since its your only option in that price range unless you want to get something used than a Odyssey+ from eBay can be a good alternative to avoid Facebook but its older and you lose out on all the wireless/standalone capabilities.  Quest2 can be connected wirelessly or with USB cable to a PC and play SteamVR games. However your 1050ti is a little weak and not even officially supported by Oculus it can be made to work with VirtualDesktop but expect to run into performance issues regularly and run everything on low with reduced resolution.  As for library size and stuff there are only really two libraries left: The Quest2 standalone library (needs a Quest2) and the SteamVR library (needs a PC every headset will work). Quest2 is the only headset that can access both libraries. SteamVR generally still has the better games as it has existed for longer and requires a PC. But most developers are moving over to Quest2 now which however is limited to mobile-VR hardware which is much less powerfull.  Oculus Rift also still has its own PCVR library which you can access with every PCVR via Revive (third party workaround tool). Its not discontinued yet but Facebook is very much moving away from PCVR there are only a handful of exclusive games in it most games can be found in the SteamVR library as well.  Oculus GearVR Go Cardboard Daydream and WMR also have their separate libraries those however can only be accessed from their respective headsets but they have very little content and are all discontinued. So nothing really you should worry about.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u5lo76/what_are_different_vr_setups_capable_of_library/i547olr/'

The bulk majority of devs are hobbyist And your risk is the same regardless (besides almost none of the regular groups pirate VR software since the market is minuscule and the effort is huge due to how frequently they’d need to redo it for updates). App lab is on quest and is majority free of charge anyway.   But really you should be supporting devs if you want decent content. Talking about an intent to do it later is a slap in their face. If you can’t afford it play something free until you can. None of the titles are very expensive and we don’t want to encourage piracy.

You are wrong about the quest library.  Because it can act as a pcvr headset too so long as you have a pcvr ready pc it actually has the widest library.  Not the smallest.    I dont think your pc meets minimum pcvr specs tho.  Theres some games you can probably play but those are on native quest anyway so you might as well buy them natively with that gpu.  In your situation I would definitely get a quest 2.

The mod simply needs Half-Life 2 to be installed and then youre all ready to run the greatest way of playing one of the best games of all time (no fooling with Gmod configs other mods etc.). Cabalistic also added full MSAA support (which looks AMAZING in VR) and DrBeef added Vulkan instead of DX9 so the performance is fantastic (with headroom for things like additional graphic mods etc.) The mod is still being worked on but there are plans to have an open beta soon.  Theres work to upscale some of the textures but thats an ongoing sideproject that hasnt been completed yet. For this video I grabbed an existing texture pack for HL2 that replaces 100% of the textures and it makes a HUGE difference in VR (as original textures are fairly low resolution). Its so much fun to be able to look at details close up in VR.  If youve already played HL2 even 100 times in the past get ready to play it in a completely new way! The physicality alone is amazing in VR. Take a look at how you can spin the blocks in the playground just by hitting them or the way you can play tetherball with a corpse in Ravenholm. Shootouts by physically dodging for cover manually reloading your guns etc. is also insanely fun.

People have voted with their feet and want low cost of entry hardware that just can’t deliver that kind of experience.  As much as I like the widening of the audience the Quest is enabling I kind of feel it’s guiding the market towards funky mini games like the mobile market.  The Quest 2 obviously can be a conduit for PCVR and the fact that it’s wireless arguably makes it the best conduit for most people who don’t feel like turning their room into a cable management dungeon but the high cost of PCs is limiting the depth of the experience.  That’s why I think the market will get more active when (if) Deckard comes out.

I did run into trouble where the capacitive sensor on the joystick stopped working (which Ive yet to find a game that uses it) but Valve has legendary support and got that sorted out right quick for me.  The only reservation Id have personally buying one today is just that there is speculation on other stuff on the horizon. Deckard if it ever becomes a thing could be super rad and worth the wait but who knows at this point.   Though it all comes down to what you really want. Personally I dont think the finger tracking stuff really adds all that much though even without that I love the controllers. One of the biggest things for me though is actually the audio the off ear speakers are just super good and not having stuff on my ears is mad comfortable.  Ive seen similar questions come up and the consensus seems to be that the index isnt worth it at the moment though as I say thats almost always because of what people are seeing on the horizon. For me knowing how much I like the hardware and how great valve is if I didnt have an index and the cash to buy one right now Id absolutely buy it without question. I cant think of many things Ive got nearly as much dollar value out of :D  That said read around see what others are saying and Im sure you can come to a good decision. Youve already got a quest which you can use to play PCVR stuff already so I dunno if youre going to get quite as much value as someone who just has a computer ready and no headset.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u631mh/is_the_valve_index_still_worth_it/i560zhn/'

I’m just looking for a VR headset than mainly runs PC games nothing else the Quest 2 when plugged into a pc compresses the video so everything looks super low res and makes it unplayable to me. The FOV for the Index is like 33% more than the quest so that’s a huge step up for me than anything and I’ve read about the support for the index is good too like if you want to replace a joystick it’s free. Ive also heard about things being on the horizon too but it’s all claims and no backups like the new Index coming soon and we don’t even know the prices even if they do come out with better headsets. I’m just looking to have fun with a PCVR headset and I don’t need the top tier headset just good immersion also thanks for the detailed experiences you had with the Index I appreciate it.

I think youre not quite understanding the terms here.  Wifi 6 is a standard used by your router to talk to wireless devices in your house such as your headset.   Your internet plan only matters between your router and your ISP - ie. outside of your house.   Theres no way that AirLink would recommend that you upgrade your internet plan - you must have misunderstood something.   Anyways plenty of people are getting great performance on AirLink and VD *literally without internet at all*.   I guess ultimately if you dont know enough about networking to properly set up wireless VR (and arent interested in learning) then maybe you really should stick to wired.   Unless Meta releases the wifi 6 USB dongle they are rumoured to be making.  Hopefully that will just be plug and play for people like you.','i56lu7v','/r/virtualreality/comments/u631mh/is_the_valve_index_still_worth_it/i56me4a/'

(Wifi 6 should have 1200 Mbps wifi AC maxes out at 866 Mbps as per the article.)   Many people purchase a 2nd router or wifi access point for VR as it allows them more freedom to locate the VR router near their play space and it gives better performance than sharing with the other devices in the house.  I have an ASUS RT-AX55 but theres been recommendations for cheaper ones in the Oculus Quest subreddit.

I would be interested in learning about alternative apps that would work on the later Samsung models myself.  For converting a series of photos to a 360° panorama the software PTGui works very well: [https://ptgui.com/download.html](https://ptgui.com/download.html) . They have a free trial version with watermarks. The full version is around 150€.  For converting multiple photos into 3D models you could have a look at RealityCapture: [https://www.capturingreality.com/](https://www.capturingreality.com/)  To watch photo spheres / 360-degree panoramas on Meta Quest and Quest 2 I would like to mention our own app immerGallery. Free demo here: [https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4598517593539197/](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4598517593539197/)  . Needs the full version to watch your own photos.  In general you might want to consider getting a 360° camera like the Insta360 ONE X2 or Ricoh Theta. It makes capturing much faster and better for dynamic objects (e.g. waves in the ocean).','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6ab08/turn_pictures_into_virtual_reality/i5723jh/'

So on the 3rd try I got the Valve Index I would say the way customer service has treated me was worth the price difference alone but its also the nicest VR hardware I have used and I love it. Comfortable great FOV the sound is still amazing to me 9 months later cant believe how great the sound is.  So for me yeah its worth it.

Thats probably because anyone with a camera can shoot a 360 photo or video quickly. It takes time and money to create 3D models and apps.  If travel apps exist you should be able to find them in app stores SteamVR Oculus etc. 360 photos and videos are everywhere.  So we have to choose ..  * View the limited number of realistic apps that exist * Go virtually anywhere via 360 photos videos or Google Street View / Google Earth (which consist of 360 photos)  With a Google Street View app like Wander or Google Earth VR you can pretty much walk all around places like Disneyland and Venice - not just a few m2. And you can often walk around in a city and walk all around the Eiffel Tower.  Limited walking might be around the Pyramids.

Theyre about twice as expensive damn near impossible to upgrade with about half the performance of a desktop. If your getting into game development I would urge you to take stock and consider if a desktop would work for you. Whatever laptop you need to properly run VR i promise you theres a desktop for half the price that would do it better. If you absolutely need to get a laptop dont get confused by the names of things look at the actual numbers of the stats they do this weird thing with GPUs and CPUs where they adopted the same names of the PC parts but without the same performance. I only feel the need to caution you becuase I while back I made the same mistake I got a high end gaming laptop and it was good for a laptop but when I went to use it for game development it fell flat on its face very early into the project.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6d43o/optimal_laptop_for_vr_gaming_and_development/i57va8g/'

And the rift product line is discontinued and abandoned at this point by oculus so forget the rift ever existed do not buy one in 2022.  Second the connection between your PC and your Quest2 (i assume is what youre talking about) has nothing to do with your internet speed.  It has to do with the wifi speed those are separate things and not the least bit related to each other.  Even if your equipment isnt sufficient to run a quest2 the quest2 doenst need a PC.  You can play VR games out of its mobileVR catalog of games on the oculus mobileVR game store appstore and applab store.  None of it needs your PC to work.    And given your apparent lack of technical knowledge you should honestly just use it as a mobileVR standalone systme and not try and plug it into your PC.  Going from a closed console like system when its playing mobileVR and is mostly trouble free to and open platform like PCVR / windows creates a lot of need for technical knowledge which you dont apparently have.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6dt39/is_adsl_a_deal_breaker_for_using_vr_on_pc/i57vtep/'

But you have to order those from online places that will have their own return policies and you may have to pay to ship it back for a return and may also need to pay a restocking fee.

Generally speaking VP2 is quite good though its pretty bulky/heavy/hot but youre used to Vive so it would be a good contender for you.  But you need to do something about that GPU for sure if you want to step up to a VP2.  1070 isnt going to cut it.  Index on the other hand would run better on the 1070 because its a lower pixel density its higher than your OG Vive but nowhere near where the latest HMDs are.  but as you say its not available in your country so you hav eto deal with importing.  It will however work fine on your OG vive light houses so will index controllers if you wanted to upgrade from wands.  I would not advise you run anything but a quest2 on a laptop.  Reason being video port issues.    Not only is finding a displayport on a laptop somewhat o fa novelty  finding one that goes to the laptops discrete GPU and not the integrated GPU weeds out most of the laptop options.  This is the #1 reason why laptops dont VR.    Then theres the heat issue VR drives the GPU hard and laptops dont have very good thermal dissipation so you can start to hit throttling issues.  If youre hell bent on doing the laptop thing at least buy a fan stand for it to push air up into the laptop from the bottom itll help some.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u68m0s/advice_for_next_headset/i57x7zf/'

And the reason you can’t find any good VR video is because up until recently HQ 180 cameras were bonkers expensive.   And when I say up until recently I mean Canon just came out with a $2000 lens for its R5 body ($5000) and that’s by far the cheapest way to make a quality VR video.    And from there they’re hard to edit.  Places like YouTube might over compress.  Your headset (the Q2) isn’t capable of a resolution of 1080p per eye anyway so all of the is moot.

If I didnt have a CV1 Q1 and Q2 my wallet would hope of the table and find its way to my computer to order one before I woke up in the morning and saw what happened.  Unfortunately the Pico Neo 3 is a contemporary of the Quest 2 and its only new western gamer audiences. The Pico products have been known to enterprise and business communities in the east and west for a long while. They have always had good fit comfort and display tech and been widely used for things like group media experiences.  So its a re-release product not a new release. Thats definitely a downer for us who are already equipped with its sub-generation of abilities.  So - if you dont mind a diversion I have one bright side that I think isnt contemplated - because its backwards and sideways and thats how my brain works.  Porting games from the Pico ecosystem to the Quest. That sounds crazy - the Quest library is so much bigger - but target audience isnt about audience size.  The more successful the Pico ecosystems are in general - the more developers will flock to it in the West AND East. Eastern studios that dont develop for VR partially because they literally cant touch the biggest VR market product in the world - will have an ecosystem they can actually touch off-the-shelf with a better shot at positive ROI.  There are good Eastern game studios doing great work - looking at you Wukong - that would could create EPIC VR experiences if the market conditions were more favorable. Just like what exists in the West but a few years behind in that market progression.  Theres even a relatively new technological enabler that makes this go from plausible and possible to almost easy and likely. Thats OpenXR. Guy Godin is waiting for OpenXR to be better on the Pico before porting over Virtual Desktop for example. Thats a both ways awesome - not just from Quest to Pico.  When OpenXR is better on the Pico - developers creating new stuff for Pico using OpenXR libraries will better be able to port to the Quest and any new standalone VR headsets.  So still root for competitors even if the technology stack is contemporary and theres nothing new. Sometimes being contemporary for whats out today is a bigger win than being new.  For todays software market and getting more companies making money making VR - the more devices that work like the Quest in enough ways to make game ports easier back and forth - the better.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6gqnt/pico_disappointed_me_and_not_because_it_is_bad/i589du0/'

Where as if you spend $1000-$1500 on a desktop youd be getting a pretty high end experience.  Have you considered getting a mid range desktop and a budget end laptop? You could do your coding on a laptop but use the desktop to power the experience. $1000-$1500 for the PC and $500 or less for the laptop?

Quest2 uses only usb so you dont need to worry about it.  So focus on getting not only the best GPU you can for your budget (it should be a 3000 series) but also get a thicker style laptop not those sub 1inch things.  Ticker laptops and cooling capacity usually go hand in hand and VR works the GPU hard so youll want a laptop with top tier cooling and they are usually the thicker ones.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6d43o/optimal_laptop_for_vr_gaming_and_development/i58kzxf/'

Basically two entry points that lands light on your sensor.  It looks a lot better than one giant fisheye lens.  And that cuts your quality per eye in half to 4k per eye (if you were using an 8k camera with a 4k camera it’s 1080p per eye).    Which may not seem like a big deal because a Q2 is basically 1080p per eye so it matches right?   No it’s 1080p for the entire 180 degrees.  Like you said you only view a little bit of the image at a time.  It’s basically like zooming in 3x on a 1080p image.    Which….  This is why things are blurry in VR.','i58hh1i','/r/virtualreality/comments/u5je7d/where_to_watch_good_quality_vr180/i58nena/'

The VR system is not just a head  mounted monitor thats now how VR works.  Some pancake games get mods later on that do allow them to work in VR.  These mods mostly dont use motion controllers though they rely on keyboard and mouse or a console type controller for the input and not your VR wands.  Specifically regarding GTA5 it does have a mod you can read more about it here  [VRScout Article](https://vrscout.com/news/grand-theft-auto-5-vr-mod/)  &#x200B  But my general advice is play VR games in VR play pancake games on a regular screen.

Games you buy inside of a quest2 or via the quest2 app on your phone are mobileVR games and do not run on a PC.  You should consider them quest2 only in the sense that they are not capable of running on a PC.  PC VR games and mobile VR games are totally separate platforms and marketplaces.

It doesnt help so much in gaming though.  Id recommend an Oculus Quest 2 which doesnt even require a gaming PC or laptop. Its a complete gaming console on its own with a good library and also offers the option to connect it to your PC to play Steam games for when you do one day get a computer with a better graphics card.  You *might* still be able to get away with playing some of the simpler Steam games on your 3050ti though through the Quest 2 but it will be a bit of a stretch.

If it is though Id go nothing less than an RTX 3070. I know theyre expensive right now due to the bad market so youd want to wait a bit.  Again the Quest 2 would be an excellent way to get into VR gaming without needing a high-end computer. Its got some of my favorite PCVR games ported to it - Pavlov Until You Fall Robo Recall In Death Beat Saber and many others.

The best comfort for sim racing is the Vive Flow.  Its actually very sick.  BUT resolution is garbage so theres always a trade-off.  I still prefer racers on the Vive Flow just for the comfort.

On other platforms creators only get like 30% or even less of the cut.  Example Rec Room creators only get 25% of the price users pay for a token and that too is at the best value pack.  The price of one token 0.16$ in the highest value pack and creators only get 0.04$ of that.  Meaning creator only gets 4 cent for a token that was purchased for 16 cents at best.  More often than not its more than 16 cents.','i52ahhv','/r/virtualreality/comments/u53ypj/meta_takes_almost_50_of_creators_money/i59bngt/'

The reason being other VR systems like your Cosmos have a video cable.  In order for a video port on a laptop to drive a VR system that port must talk to the laptops discrete GPU.  The #1 reason laptops fail at VR is because the video port goes to the integrated GPU and the good discrete GPU is only used for the screen.  So yes you should have done a lot more research before buying a laptop for a VR system.   Quest2 gets around this problem becasue it doesnt need a video port it works over USB instead.','i592uym','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6lige/im_new_to_vr_can_any_pc_game_vr_game_run_on_any/i59i56e/'

You may be keying graphics over the top downstream from capture - like AR or you may be using led panels so the image is behind on a screen.  This is trickier with rear led panels but you can render each camera’s frustum - which is to say just that camera’s field of view which is shown on the screen behind.  As long as the cameras weren’t overlapping in where they’re pointing you can have several virtual backgrounds on the same screen.

You stick all these ir reflective dots on the ceiling of the studio and this MoSys box is basically a camera that looks upwards and works out its position (very accurately) by looking at the constellations on the ceiling.  The really hard thing to get right with virtual production is de-warping the image that the camera produces (this is in ar work).  You need to build a quite complex table of data for each lens you use with curvature data for each focal distance across the whole range of the zoom on the lens.  You need to track the zoom/focus position using encoders so you can either undistort the camera feed or distort the graphics you render.  If you don’t do this perfectly it’s looks like rubbish.','i5bc6x5','/r/virtualreality/comments/u6t9vi/htc_teases_xr_related_device_they_believe_is_a/i5bcnhe/'

Whether or not a game is cross-buy compatible is up to the individual developers.  That a developer has said that they trying to make it cross-buy makes me think it will be since its their decision.

I run three tundras (two on feet one on hip) and then two vive trackers on elbows (total of 8 trackers which includes headset controllers).   Tundra trackers are new super lightweight days to set up and have an amazing battery life of 6+ hours on a full charge.  Vive trackers you are lucky to get 3 hours and are heavier and bulkier. If tundra had been around before I would have skipped getting my vive trackers and invested in 6 of these tundras.  To do full body it is suggested you go with three trackers and a minimum of two base stations. You will get a smoother look vs only tracking your feet.  I will leave my vrc username below if anyone would like to add and come chill. Happy to answer more questions or make friends with those who enjoy VR.

For the past few years the *cameras* were the real limit as they couldnt even make use of the limited headset resolution we had. The latest cameras get close to what a Quest2 can handle but are still below a G2 or VivePro2. Keep in mind 8k split over two eyes and 180° is just around 22 PPD. Human vision is 60 PPD. And you have to film that at 60fps (120fps if you want to max out the headset).  Another big issue the h265 codec only goes up to 8192×4320 so even if you somehow can make the video there is no VR compatible video format to stuff it into.  There are ways around some of these issues like the Viewport-splitting that DeoVR is doing (i.e. splitting into smaller video segments so you dont cover the full 180° at once but only what you are actively looking at).  But at that point you have to basically develop your own camera rig player and stuff. There is no easy off-the-shelves solution for this.  The most practical and easiest solution for high-res VR these days might be to just drop the VR180 and go with VR120 or even VR90. That removes the ability to look around in the video but it gives you a lot more resolution without taxing the headset or camera. But you still have develop your own rig and player as everything is build around VR180 at the moment and lower FOVs arent supported.','i5feh02','/r/virtualreality/comments/u765rq/thoughts_on_the_idea_of_plays_in_stereoscopic_3d/i5g3xno/'

It needs to be locked down on a tripot or limited to very slow and constant motion (e.g. slowly moving forward for the whole shot).  That said I do think VR180 videos could be a lot more dynamic. But you have to use snap-turn and teleportation to jump between different cameras you cant smoothly move around the scene.  It might also be a good idea to project the video at the orientation that it was filmed in e.g. when filming upwards show the video above the viewer not in front of them such that the horizon is always level.','i5dlgk4','/r/virtualreality/comments/u765rq/thoughts_on_the_idea_of_plays_in_stereoscopic_3d/i5g4tdv/'

'i5gfe6k','2022-04-20 01:05:02','mrweb06','u7qmhz','If your VR gear vanished what exactly would you buy?','Since you said you had Oculus SDK Im assuming you want a PCVR experience. Ive been using 2 Quest almost daily for the past 2 months mainly for PCVR.  I also had the opportunity to buy a G2. One maybe minor disadvantage of G2 as it not having capacitive sensors on its controllers while it almost being a standard at this point. This feature afaik is mainly important in social VR applications since you can use hand gestures. The main reason I had for getting a Q2 was well its so god damn popular there are incredible amount of accessories you can get for it.  If you choose to go for a Quest 2 (mind you has a higher resolution than an Index) Id recommend:  * Knuckle strap covers for motion controllers. Constantly having to grab onto controllers isnt the best thing and event hough these straps wont make them Index Knuckle Controllers the QoL improvement is very real. * 5 meters of USB 3.1 cable you dont have to get the expensive fiberoptic Quest Link cable. There are plenty of good quality and cheaper alternatives. * From word of mouth I learned Quest 2 Elite Straps are still breaking. Ill soon to be getting a Kiwi Design Elite Strap since that was the most recommended one to me. Another recommended was BoboVR M2.In the meantime I strapped a rectangular powerbank with some cable management straps to the back of the Q2s default cloth strap as counterweight. This alone improved comfort massively. * A pair of Sennheiser CX-300 II is still good enough for spatial audio. More often than not the subtle environmental sounds in Half-Life Alyx would make me stop and turn on the passthrough cameras to see if anyone in the house was actually coming into my room.   There are even some off-ear speakers like on Index or G2 as accessory. But I havent really checked them out.  There are some hiccups to Q2. Firstly its Meta... Moving on...   It uses compressed video stream the quality can be improved to the point of not noticing any artifacts via official Oculus Debug Tool. One thing you cant really address (unless you lower the stream resolution) is the amount of VRAM Oculus app uses to compress the stream. The app can use total of 1.2-1.6 GB of VRAM. So Id definitely recommend a GPU with a minimum of 8 GB of VRAM.  Even with the tinkering required Id still go for another Q2 until something better comes up in a couple of years.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7qmhz/if_your_vr_gear_vanished_what_exactly_would_you/i5gfe6k/'

Reverb G2) is more suitable when you have a very large number of users such as a classroom.   With standalone and wireless theres the problem of getting good enough wifi to handle all the headsets along with juggling accounts and content depending on the platform.   PCs can be connected via ethernet and PCVR platforms tend to be more permissive regarding content sharing.  And / or youre deploying your own content which again is easier to do on PC.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7qwzo/what_commercial_uses_would_pc_vr_be_more/i5gg3fs/'

And yeah you got it im looking at PCVR as opposed to standalone or anything. From this if I hypothetically passed on the Q2 for now (Or had it as an alternative/backup headset) would you consider the G2 paired with Valves knuckles controllers as a good overall setup? Do they even work together? Im looking to definitely get into social games like VRChat and whatnot so I think the knuckles controllers would be best for that like you said. Additionally how do you feel about FBT? It seems the only immediately available option right now is still the Vive 3.0 trackers as the new trackers are either out of stock or are only up for preorder at this moment.      Also that note about having to turn on passthrough to see if sound was coming from your irl space that is awesome hahah. I really hope to have an experience like that someday.

I don’t know if Pimax has their own licensed software or not but making sure the headsets and their technologies are cross compatible with other softwares and systems is crucial. What is uncomfortable is having to tweak with hardware and mess with drivers and manuals. Making sure the Pimax runs well on a diverse set of systems is by far the most comfort you can provide to companies and the people who actually set up and design the training.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7qwzo/what_commercial_uses_would_pc_vr_be_more/i5gh31t/'

The issue was never general VR adoption it was the quality of tracking and how that interacted with the experience.  The quest has taken off not because it’s basically easy access phone hardware but because it does 6DoF well on top of being really accessible.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7sf1x/phone_vr_anything_current_or_in_the_works_anything/i5gl2vi/'

I wouldnt have bought my first HMD just because of this - and a lot of other people especially people who dont know anything about VR just know about phone VR (and maybe beat saber but that is a big maybe).  Phone VR is just very limiting for example you can only have 3DoF and the experiences are outright terrible (some small exceptions but ehh..) maybe there is something better now but it is still 3DoF and not representative of the 6DoF on VR headsets.  And then the next point phone screens just hurt at those close distances. At least for me.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7sf1x/phone_vr_anything_current_or_in_the_works_anything/i5glgx7/'

You can externally in real time deploy new assets and new situations that you simply cant do with standalone as it simply doesnt have that compute power a quest stutters just loading a beat saber level lol.  And while there is bound to be a response about airlink just no.  Even forgetting the logistics of functionality and deployment a quest 2 IPD doesnt match everyone so world scale will be off kind of a deal breaker when trying to train precision for say accurately judging distance to shoot down a moving helicopter....  And then the latency and compression absolutely not acceptable in training situations like this.  Not to mention inside out tracking while hugely convenient has huge trade offs holding a pair of binoculars to your face like shown for example will make inside out tracking shit itself you dont need technical drawbacks when it comes tracking fluidity in training asking someone to hold their hands out away from head isnt what they will do in the field.   While use of a standalone with pre loaded training apps is still absolutely useful for sure take Walmarts GO deployment for the average employee to get upto speed or any evaluation tests in simulated hazardous situations for industrial enterprises  I wouldnt say when you are being evaluated and trained for something in military applications that current inside out tracking and standalone headset power is enough if the tools cant serve the purpose then its wasted and looks like a gimmick.  There is a big reason HTC although looked at as overpriced and same-same to consumers are HUGE in enterprise and training a Vive pro 2 eye or whatever isnt meant for those wanting to play beat saber and is such a high resolution you need serious literally the best consumer PC compute power right now to fully drive it.    For us mere consumers I dont understand why there isnt an external brainbox we do not need any more resolution on screens the lenses are good enough now why not have 1 simple bloody wire going into your pocket or belt buckle so that you can have a hugely lighter headset upgradability longer headset life and have choice.  1 wired chunky phone shaped brick isnt a deal breaker if it means you can have quest 2 power for cheap or the latest and greatest APU and push more render resolution to that panel a quest 2 standalone doesnt even get close to using half of the panel Res more like a quarter surely an upgradable external device is better the headset itself is fine upgrade the little box down the line not create e waste from chucking a headset that the internal battery has died on.','i5g54wk','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7nppo/using_oculus_rift_with_backpack_pc_to_train/i5gllyn/'

Shouldnt be too hard to get the most out of it.   It also gets you the SteamVR lighthouses. You can then upgrade your headset keeping the same controllers and lighthouses.

Quest 2 cause everything else is either too expensive or lacks some features/quality that I deem as necessary.  Second best choice would be Reverb G2 (V2). Being tethered only is big bummer after experiencing wireless PCVR (even when its only a streaming solution with compression artifacts and added latency) but this headset gives you one of the best visual and acoustic VR experiences for a decent price. WMR tracking and controllers are ... tolerable.  Im a little bit disappointed when it comes to VR headsets progression in general. Since the first reputable commercial headsets in the form of Rift CV1 and HTC Vive we didnt really get any headset I see worthy of being called VR 2.0.   Especially when it comes to ergonomy and weight I have the feeling it got even worse over time. A lot of newer headsets are bigger and heavier than mentioned first gen VR headsets from 2016. So after six years I dont see a real game changer.  We got Standalone in form of Quest Focus Pico Neo ... but this is more like a addon without really progressing on most of the existing hardware and issues. In some ways we even got steps backward like switching from OLED to LCD. Maybe this was a nice choice for the producers to lower costs and mitigating some issues with OLED like ghosting but the lack of deep blacks and good colors hurts so much more in VR compared to flatscreen gaming.  Since I upgraded from Rift to Quest 2 cause of LCD my immersion and depth perception got at least 15-20% worse even if the higher resolution and almost no SDE are nice but thats really it. Most headsets just got higher and higher display resolution everything else is in stale or even regressing.  I dont have much hope left for 2022 cause seemingly a lot of headset release got delayed or even changed specs to something worse (like for example Cambria most likely planned to release with uOLED or at least a second more expensive version having it but now it seems they will use LCD with MiniLED backlightning).   I really hope we will see some exciting uOLED + pancake lens headsets at least in 2023. Even better with WiGig2 support/option. I want something like the Arpara 5K but in good. Even if its only tethered a 200g headset with these specs but Meta/HTC quality and software would be a dream right now. Im tired of heavy headsets.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7qmhz/if_your_vr_gear_vanished_what_exactly_would_you/i5grmsq/'

Also the LCDs and optics in the 1st gen WMRs are *complete garbage*. No IPD slider so everything looks like blur. Colors that look like a TN panel from the early 2000. God rays as far as the eye can see. If you bought one for $150 that might all be very acceptable compromises especially a few years ago. But 1st gen WMRs really just feel like what they are: 1st gen VR tech from five years ago.  What they have going for them is more resolution and a cheaper price than a Vive or CV1 but Odyssey+ is way ahead of all of those and there is not much reason to not get a O+ if you want HDMI (O+ is nearly impossible to find in Europe however so 1st gen WMR might be the only option there).','i5gt4ot','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7s64p/pcvr_headsets_with_hdmi_support/i5guffj/'

I can’t afford stuff like that so I haven’t tried myself haha.  I just assumed the super expensive stuff these companies sell works.      I forget….  But I feel like 8K (4k per eye) is past what the Oculus can tell the difference between and you’d need a better headset? The q2 is 1080 but like you said when filming you split 8k by 2 for each eye.  And then watching it in the headset effectively zooms in.    Anyway.   If filming 8k is past what the q2 can tell the difference between….  The best videos I’ve watched on the Q2 have been tolerable.  Kind-of sucks if that’s our camera limit though with the headsets all slated to increase their resolution going forward.','i5g3xno','/r/virtualreality/comments/u765rq/thoughts_on_the_idea_of_plays_in_stereoscopic_3d/i5gwhlw/'

It seems the only immediately available option right now is still the Vive 3.0 trackers as the new trackers are either out of stock or are only up for preorder at this moment.  Im not really looking forward for FBT since my current play space is basically just standing and not roomscale. Heck I even dont have 360 degree cover since I have to give my back to my wardrobe.     That being said there are alternatives to FBT other than Vive trackers  * [HaritoraX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ4EnAgDA9E) is a set of IMU sensors and if I remember correctly you can use them with any headset. Not the best tracking performance out there since they dont use laser tracking or camera tracking but they seem to work fine and one main advantage for it as stated in the review: they can not be occluded.    Side note: Ive seen other Vive Base Stations users having trouble with tracking from time to time when they have reflective surfaces in the room like windows glass frames posters with gloss finish etc. All of these cons said laser Base Station tracking is till the best performing and the most accurate tracking method. * If you will go for Index controllers anyway you can have better Vive trackers than Vive trackers currently are: [Tundra Trackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohzJkvHHqc)  &#x200B  >Also that note about having to turn on passthrough to see if sound was coming from your irl space that is awesome hahah.

Imagine a phone that did VR released by a company other than Google. It would have to run the Google play store. The company would neither be able to ensure that purchases were made through their App Store nor that the VR function was used at all.  Phones work largely because people are willing to pay the effective cost of the hardware (with small subsidy from pack in apps etc).  The other side is that people expect much better processors and tend to look at phones through specs the price point achieved by the quest through the balancing of specs (which are not looked at by the consumer as they have avoided the phone classification) so using something as shamefully old as the XR2 would not be possible a “bleeding edge” processor would be required every year.  I could be wrong though. It could be the new product category next year.

Id buy what I just pre-ordered but its not relevant right now since its Europe only and I think the pre-orders are largely sold out anyway - the Pico Neo 3 Link. Quest 2 pricing Quest 2 features (much worse game store tho) + the link part is that you can connect it to a PC with a Displayport 1.4 cable and it becomes a full-on SteamVR headset that basically rivals the HP Reverb G2 very similar 4K resolution and it even has better edge to edge clarity.  Downside: China and ByteDance are involved.  Other than that if I had an Nvidia 3080 or better for graphics Id get the Pimax 8KX. Just for that crazy FOV. Of course price just tripled or more from the Pico.   But they do let you trade in the HMD for the upcoming Pimax 12K and give you the full purchase price back so theres that. Of course the 12K is way north of $2 grand just for the HMD.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7qmhz/if_your_vr_gear_vanished_what_exactly_would_you/i5h2j5f/'
'i5h37ub','2022-04-20 05:46:11','hgusella173','u765rq','thoughts on the idea of plays in stereoscopic 3D?','> The q2 is 1080   The Quest2 is 1832×1920 per eye with a FOV of around 97x98° per eye. If you map that to a VR180 video you end up with a necessary per-eye resolution of around 3399x3526 for 180°. Due to resolution not being equally distributed over the FOV (sharper in the center) you might even need a little more to make full use of the headset. So basically 4k per eye or 8k total.  > I just assumed the super expensive stuff these companies sell works.  Insta360 Titant can do:  10560 x 5280 @30fps (11K 2D)  9600 x 9600 @30fps (10K 3D)  7680 x 7680 @50fps  7680 x 3840 @60fps  5248 x 2624 @120fps  So it gets better than 8k resolution but only at 30fps once you go 60fps you are back in sub-8k. Another big problem with those bulky 360 cameras is that they do not allow you to get close to the subject you have to stay about 1 meter away from anything you film or you might run into weird stitching artifacts. Thats a huge issue given that VR looks best when things are up close. A plain VR180-3D camera with only two lenses allows you to get up to 10cm before it gets weird.  And finally there is the issue that VR360 feels like a complete waste of video in most situations as there is never really anything interesting happening behind the camera. It just makes it much harder to film as you no longer have any place to hide your crew teleprompter and stuff. If you film a theater play in VR360 half the video is spend for the audience. Thats why VR180 is generally a much better way to film stuff keeps file size small and allows you to point the camera at the action instead of having the user spin around in circles trying to find something interesting.','i5gwhlw','/r/virtualreality/comments/u765rq/thoughts_on_the_idea_of_plays_in_stereoscopic_3d/i5h37ub/'

It can also play some other games standalone I guess but I dont really care that much. At least Pico tosses in the deluxe battery strap that you basically are forced to buy for the Quest if you want any kind of comfort.   As for being tracked that sucks on both. Choices are mandatory login to Facemetabook and thus tracking of everything you do or no forced login to anything with the Pico but probably still tracking of everything you do by ByteDance.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7urq7/oculus_quest_2_vs_pico_neo_3/i5h3p29/'

The modmic fixes that.  I do have FBT but its really ghetto and temporary. Im using a kinect 360 and a spare phone with owotrack for that. Its cheap and not great but Ive got SlimeVR trackers eventually coming. The next gen Pimax 12k headset will have a FBT module that might be neat since it wont require you to strap things on yourself.

It’s well worth the extra $60 expense to mod a Quest 2 imo.   The display port might be considered a major advantage to the few and the proud who are playing wired pcvr. But if you’re playing wirelessly airlink continues to improve with updates whereas it’s not clear to me where the quality of Pico’s wireless software capability stands.

Thats actually really unlikely. Firstly it would be incredibly easy to detect if that were happening so if it is well know about it. Secondly the sheer amount of useless data that would provide would be overwhelming. Meta isnt doing it either they gather data about you directly through Facebook which is a million times cheaper easier to use and useful to them than whatever they could get through cameras.      Yes the Chinese government sucks but when an authoritarian government wants to spy on people they pick individual targets or groups and monitor them directly. They dont blanket spy on hundreds of millions of people and use incredible amounts of computing resources to separate the wheat through the endless chaff. That would be extremely inefficient and wasteful. CCP doesnt give a shit about whats in Joe Randoms in Torontos living room. Would I buy a Pico headset if I was someone they would actually WANT to spy on like a politician or diplomat or something? Probably not Id certainly be more careful about it and wait until someone investigates whether its phoning home or not.','i5hbxzy','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7wbse/chinese_analyst_pico_will_release_a_pro_headset/i5hf3k3/'

Even if you somehow could accurately predict the onset for a particular user at a particular point in time their very next session might allow for longer legs so your first prediction is no longer valid.  Also how would you adapt the experience? Are you just going to switch to TP or enable snap turn mid-game? Any sort of adaptation will be noticeable and jarring. You would also need some sort of universal API to allow you to change settings across all games which would be impossible to get adopted industry-wide.

'i5hlbt6','2022-04-20 07:57:01','StaRky_FR','u7urq7','Oculus quest 2 vs Pico neo 3','Ive been developing on Pico Neo 3 Pro for about a year now (Neo 3 is the same I believe but less expensive).   And there are a couple différences even though its clearly a clone of the Quest :     Hardware :   The Pico is more balance and a bit more confortable out of the box. The strap is not replaceable easily since the batterie cable goes through the top strap. I personally dont like this way of fixing the headset to the head since it does not work out for ladies with pony tails or hair attached but its better than stock quest 2.   The global build quality of the Pico is lower than the quest. Controllers are a bit jerky and the plastic a rougher every where in the headset.   The pico facial interface is grey making it way more sensitive to reflects (very bad point !). The plastic of the facial interface is more prone to sweating.   There are two usb C ports one for charging and transfering data and the other for usb-C Display port connection. Its a bit silly to have two ports but the display port allows for way less compression using a PC.   On the performance side its exactly the same on paper. Same chip same memory same technology... BUT the software is way less optimized     Software :   Lets simply say that Pico lacks 3 years of consumer usage to make the software work properly. The good news is that its getting better at each updates and the bad news is that there is a very long way to go !   There is no handtracking but the pico allow for gaze interaction if you have no controllers.   The gardian is not as good as Quest but since 4 month it is not lost every time you open the headset.   The library is still super small ! At best half of what you have on Quest is available and Sidequest is not really into Pico for now.     You may think that Pico is the choice if you want to avoid Facebook but the main opponent of Facebook in China is Bytedance and they litteraly bought pico a few month ago. So you can expect at least as much data dependencies from Pico than from Quest. If you look into tech article youll realize that chinese dont really care about that law of data and such while Meta is closely being monitored for it (it steals a lot !).     Thats the main things that comes in my mind for now. I hope it helps !','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7urq7/oculus_quest_2_vs_pico_neo_3/i5hlbt6/'

Some of my friends struggle with other titles/genres compared to myself.  In the beginning most of us (except one lucky bastard) had to start with stationary experiences or using teleport movement. When it comes to smooth locomotion I needed a lot of time to feel comfortable. After 10-12 sessions of Onward which successively became longer each time it made click and since then I can play this type of movement without issues.  My friends accustomed themselves way faster. On the other side when we first started with Echo VR they needed several hours to not feel bad while for me it was good after 30-45min.  My personal cryptonite are racing games and that makes me sad cause this was one of the genres I hoped to rekindle in VR after ignoring it for 10+ years. The nausea kicks in so fast (like after driving a few turns with the car) that I cant even tell if there is a chance for my brain to adapt. I also struggle with smooth camera turning (preferring snap) and I think this translates to racing games.  The biggest issue is that I feel dizzy for the rest of the day or even until the next one so trying it further is a fight with myself. Hey I can play 5-10min of racing and feel shit all day or play something else and enjoy a little bit of VR.  Hope it will become better in the future with upcoming headsets.

Hopefully they listen to feedback and change the account system.

'i5hqt50','2022-04-20 08:33:07','GmoLargey','u7urq7','Oculus quest 2 vs Pico neo 3','Ive had dk2 cv1 rift s oculus go quest 1 and now quest 2.  Ive ordered my pico and plan to use it as the ONLY headset as its finally a true two in one with great specs.  The quest 2 is a great standalone headset but is shit at pcvr doubly so if using steam VR ontop.  Dont get me wrong virtual desktop is great but its still up against compression by its implementation so finally having a steam VR headset with no oculus runtime overhead and no compression from cable cant fucking wait.  The Pico is still a standalone headset with identical specs to quest 2 but better comfort and crucially can do PCVR as youd want it uncompressed with no additional latency via its dedicated PC connection.  Game wise Facebook have the lead FOR NOW but heres the thing Devs will easily be able to port any existing oculus games that arent funded and exclusive and rake in extra cash for little work as specs are near identical.  Facebook will keep chucking money at exclusive stuff but if your coming from PCVR those games arent the be all and end all as you are ultimately still using it in standalone mode at a little over 1/4 the Res of the panel with soon to be locked 45fps with ASW  Green Hell being the first game now using the new implementation and guess what its exactly the same as its been on PC with visual artifacts and ghosting hands. coming from silky smooth 90hz on PC for years now thats a huge downgrade I bought the quest 2 because it was 90hz over my quest 1s 72hz Im not going to ever get immersed using it at a reprojected 45fps.  The other big kicker is store moderation look at the half assed attempt of applab you cant see any of those games without knowing exactly the title and spelling of it and searching manually and their are great games completely hidden unless you know.  That means much easier and broader scope for those games going to Pico store too without being subject to Facebooks walled garden so more games on pico very rapidly.  Then considering what you get in the box the Pico is ultimately better value want an official battery strap for quest 2? Immediately more expensive than pico and itll eventually break.  Cable for PC doesnt really matter on quest so you dont need an official link cable unless you want to charge and have a lighter cable but cost is much more again however the result in headset from both visuals and latency not to mention performance overhead all mean its worse than the dedicated video cable included with the Pico.  And as link or airlink cannot function without android headset always needs to be on updated and relying on Facebooks server and the android app not crashing just for PCVR.  With pico you plug the cable in and done like any PC headset before no charging no updates to match no android app crashes in headset.   Listen Ive been exclusively using oculus headsets and can honestly say that quest 2 is my last oculus missed the trick of simply doing what Pico has done by adding the display port cable quest 2 has great screen specs but you can never truly appreciate them and never will in its standalone form.  All in people thinking this will flop are morons Facebook cant sell headsets in Germany or China two huge markets.  For the Pico to cost what it does especially now with current material and logistic costs is a bargain and you loose NOTHING in the headset specs even freeing yourself of Facebooks servers want to use a throw away email sure play pc without booting headset into android sure.  Its a complete win the games will come dont worry about that if youve been around long enough youd know the oculus GO had a huge collection of games and apps that for absolutely no logical reason arent playable on your quest 2 wait what?!?  I should have hundreds more games that I already own on oculus but I dont because for Facebook reasons Id have to stick to my quest 1 to still play them not my more powerful quest 2.  With the Pico I can play anything even mobile games and apps sideloaded as its just android like it was open on the oculus GO not Facebooks locked down version of Android on quest 2.  So straight away I have a headset that can play pcvr properly still give me the freedom to do wireless PCVR if I ever needed to still have the standalone aspect at no feature or graphical quality and tracking loss yet also have more games and apps I can chuck on that I know will work in headset Kodi again sure steamlink sure ps streamer sure Xbox streamer sure.  Its the headset I wanted my quest 2 to be lets me do more with my headset and costs less overall than the same storage price quest.  that makes it better in my opinion.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7urq7/oculus_quest_2_vs_pico_neo_3/i5hqt50/'

Personally I prefer neo 3 over oculus - it has better build quality is more comfortable to wear and better balanced because of battery pack on the back of headstrap controllers are a little bigger and in my opionion are more comfortable. Also you dont have to create any account to use the headset. Neo 3 Streaming Assistant application allows connecting headset to PC by wire or wireless (works seamlessly with steam vr). Quest has better software (hand tracking for example) better games library and integration with meta (for better or worse).   Personally if I would buy headset for myself then I would pick Neo 3 because I lean towards SteamVR/PC gaming and the device is better designed (by a little). If you are tech geek I would recommend to think about Pico Neo 3 Eye because from my perspective (developer) foveated rendering will be a more and more popular in near future.

They dont use motion controls so you wont be aiming with your controller like in a typical the VR shooter. They use something called alternate eye rendering which some people have nausea / headache issues with especially on fast movement scenes. Overall they tend to be more comfortable to play sitting down. GTA V is the only one thats available for free cyberpunk is only available through their patreon but you will also get their VR mod for Red Dead 2 and the mafia trilogy.

'i5i10kc','2022-04-20 09:38:55','kizzle69','u80boj','Saints & Sinners performance issues','2 things.   First your system is definitely on the low end of the supported specs. The bare minimum AMD GPU supported is the RX480 and the RX580 is not much more powerful beating it by less than 5% in most titles. Both of which suffer at higher resolution game play. Theyre both 1080p cards and each eye of the Quest 2 has higher resolution than a single 1080p screen. So youre really asking a lot of that RX580  Second and most importantly even with higher end hardware this PCVR game runs poorly after they released the Aftershocks DLC. I have tried it on an RTX 2080 Ti an RTX 3080 and an RTX 3090. Without subsampling and running the settings on low it stutters badly.... So dont go and upgrade your hardware for only this game.

Or your Keyboard?  The Pico can be a dumb peripheral controlled solely by the PC.  The PC can still have internet access update games via steam etc with the Pico only acting as a controller and HMD.  Even disregarding using it solely for PC purposes Network and internet are two similiar but different things.  Even using it as a standalone you can keep it on a network and play multiplayer with people on the local network.  Since this was first released as a business headset one of the first demonstrations was a fleet of headsets updating its software from a server on the local network.  That server can get its data from the internet or you can manually add it to the server.    The headset itself is a full-fledged piece of hardware that doesnt require a pico account or contact with the Pico servers to function.  If you use it correctly you can make certain that there is no privacy problem and no information sent to Pico.    Will most people do this?  Probably not Ive mentioned before that the hope is for the headset to be a trojan horse for most users personal information but one of the few benefits this headset has over a Quest 2 is that if used in a certain way it has no privacy issues.','i5iayga','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7wbse/chinese_analyst_pico_will_release_a_pro_headset/i5if429/'

The gameplay was hyper-immersive and super fun but the sky is full of cracks oftentimes levels dont make sense and have weird dead ends and the enemies outside of the robot headset headcrabs dont have that visceral sense of destruction other games do when taking care of them.  Nothing feels real because the point is that it isnt.

Once I read the lore behind it all it all made way more sense and became way more clear. But the actual in game story telling was crap.  All in all none of it was terrible.

Looking around is fine. I tried removing TAA with the .ini mod and the shimmers nearly blinded me so not sure thats the way to go.

Setting up base stations is mildly annoying but you only need to do it once.  I set them up a few years ago with my old OG Vive and I havent need to mess with anything since even in software even with new headsets like the Index or Pimax when I plugged them in my old room setup just worked with the new headsets steam VR tracked headsets.  I have found myself having to do room setup with the Quest more often it regularly forgets the rooms I have it set up in.  Through the process is not hard to do to be fair.  Point is Index/Vive (or any headset that requires base stations) is not for everyone but dont let the setup be the reason you dont go this route!

Especially the controllers beat everything else by a long shot (though of course with some hassle you can use those with other HMDs as well).  I think the Index gets a lot of negative attention *because* its one of the most expensive. People dont post when everything works as expected they post when theyre dissapointed something failed in a very expensive device. The failure rate is most likely not different from any other headset. The vast majority of people have had no hardware issues with their Index whatsoever. Even if you do Valve has very good customer service. My own experience was plug and play everything has worked perfectly so far on the hardware side. And thats including hitting furniture a couple of times...Okay like 10-20 times. Hard enough to cut my hand open on 3 occasions lol. The build quality seems pretty good to me.  Ive never really heard of cooling problems on the Index? Do you mean the electronics or face sweat? Sweating in a HMD is an issue in pretty much every headset but the Index is not any worse than others afaik. I thought the Quest2 was worse than the Index in that regard but thats the only other HMD I had a chance to try.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u843y4/trying_to_buy_a_vr_headset_but_im_paranoid/i5j2ou4/'

That was enough for me nostalgia for a game Ive finished exactly once prior to the VR version not factoring in at all.','i5iqm1q','/r/virtualreality/comments/u82f08/resident_evil_4_vr_the_mercenaries_quest_2_trailer/i5j81p2/'

And the ironic part of your statement is  how easy it is for anyone with a bit of know how and social engineering to get into your private stuff is hilarious  Oh like Facebook/meta..... Not like theyve been caught social engineering themselves or selling off personal data for other parties to do so with.  Difference here is Facebook is intertwined into my friends and family and even if I delete it today doesnt matter whos info gets sold off its one big interconnected chunk and they also have that data of anyone youve ever talked messaged added as friend or clicked on profile for active or not ie the cambridge analyitica scandal.  But yes China could apparently see me waving my arms around in my pants if I connect to WiFi and I should apparently be worried.....

Most headsets are only fully clear near the centre of the lense so youll need to turn your head to read text at the edges of your virtual screen.   Also headsets arent quite high resolution enough to match the pixel density of a good monitor so text will again be a little less clear.  Obviously the really high res headsets will be better but then you get to compare with really high res monitors etc.   If you think of it more like a cheap TV or projector and less like a monitor then its kinda fine I guess.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8beul/vr_headset_as_monitor/i5kmncr/'

Its gotten a lot more popular lately which is nice. Theres a bunch of custom content now which is cool.  Walkabout Minigolf is a bit of a shot in the dark here but its actually super fun and a really chill game thats super immersive.   Pistol Whip is pretty great  If you like space games Star Wars Squadrons is pretty fun not a lot of players now but there are still games to be found. Single player is pretty fun too.   Vox Machinae is a fantastic mech combat game I cant recommend enough. Also supports non-vr players so getting some games with friends may be easier. Iron Rebellion is another mech game thats pretty promising but I havent spent enough time with it to give it a full recommendation yet so far its pretty fun though feels a lot faster than Vox if you prefer that kinda thing.  Speaking of if you havent played Payday2 in VR you absolutely should cause its awesome and a great example of how stapling VR to an existing game can work.  If you like strategy games Final Assault is got a lot more going on under the surface than it might look on the cover. Its a really nice take on the RTS genre and does a lot to make it work very well in VR. Drawing the paths of airplanes pretty much never gets old.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5ktx1m/'

I dont think I can care about short and small VR native games apart from something like Thrill of the Fight 2 which is more of an exercise tool than a game for me.

And its not asking any more money than quest2 it doesnt need to do a one up developers have an easy time porting and as such more games get made for both parties although youll be seeing it on app lab for oculus as they are strict on what they allow giving Devs freedom on Pico store means those complaints of no games will go away very quickly.','i5jn1si','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7urq7/oculus_quest_2_vs_pico_neo_3/i5l32lg/'

Something application specific like Predicted Motion or Simulator Sickness on a scale of 1-10 would not exactly be easy but could be based on the vergance between HMD orientation compared to recorded viewport motion etc.  You would combined analysis of VRS file data and some kind of Computer Vision ML on the captured gameplay output.

A sword an off hand shotgun a grappling hook. The game is stunningly beautiful too.  hellblade: senuas sacrifice - in VR this is epic especially with good audio (Index good headphones etc)  Sucker Punch VR - like pong on steroids daily competition.  Pistol Whip - dont skip leg day  Blair Witch VR - beautiful forest. Fun spooky story  Elite Dangerous - amazing in VR until you get out of your ship and walk around so dont get Odyssey  TribeXR - Almost as good as DJing IRL  The Forest - love it. Those caves in VR are nuts   Synth Riders - great community great music  Ragnaröck - my favourite rhythm game  Eye of the Temple - one of the greatest achievements in room scale VR in a technical masterpiece and a good series of puzzles. Needs a reasonable play space.  Pulsar Lost Colony. Its a little janky in VR but its multiplayer and a lot of fun with a decent crew.  Vermillion and Kingspray - get drawing and painting.

But these are definitely worth giving shot imo.  1- [SpaceEngine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/314650/SpaceEngine/) is the biggest planetarium you probably can have.  >SpaceEngine is a 1:1 scale science-based Universe simulator featuring billions upon billions of galaxies nebulae stars and planets all shown at their full real-world scale. Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away or visit anything in between seamlessly with no transitions.  It has full motion control support as well. And for VR they added a scaling option that wouldnt work in pancake you can change the scale of the universe as you wish and fly/walk through it. You really can gain perspective on how big space actually is when you *literally* *try to walk through it.* It was already a unique experience as I put hours flying in it in pancake VR took it to another age for me. Ive found myself trying to breathe in basketball sized vibrantly colorful nebulae for example. This is really something else.  2-[Elite Dangerous](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/Elite_Dangerous/) is a well known space sim with VR support. No motion controller support but has great cockpit experience. You dont need the Odyssey DLC as it adds on foot FPS combat (which has no VR support). But free cam mode on foot still does it in VR so you can have a sense of scale for the ships settlements space stations etc. Flying through planetary rings in VR is definitely a great experience in this.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5lejf4/'

Taught me how to play etc. Very helpful.  Me and my friend with vr were scared shitless and pretty much useless but it was an experience.  So I had two others try the game with us and they simply didnt play the same game. They were bored. They cheesed the ghost on a kitchen counter so it then would only run after me. And quite simply put they werent there with me. Not even the same game.  They ruined it. Granted some people play the game as intended but these guys would not be busy doing that shit if they had the real experience. That said I do like games having pancake compatibility but phasmophobia certainly got ruined.  Just compare rec room trolls on pancake to those kids in VR. At least theyre there having fun pancake people are just disconnected and act very differently and trolling commences.','hnz23yq','/r/virtualreality/comments/rcyhsv/among_us_officially_made_for_vr/i5lf4cx/'

Detached is the more intense experience since movement is along all three axes Horus is more comfortable to play.  **Eye of the Temple** is a great room scale Indiana Jones style adventure where you walk thru your physical space. You need a 6.5x6.5 foot area to play it.  **I Expect You to Die** and **I Expect You to Die 2** are great spy based puzzle/escape room games  **V-Racer: Hoverbike** **Grip Combat** Racing and **Redout** are three fun futuristic space racers.  **Hovrboard** is a fun hoverboard style game with fun tricks and movement mechanics  **House of the Dying Sun** is a good cockpit based space shooter.  **Karnage Chronicles** is a good dungeon crawler that can be played alone or co-op  **Project Cars 2** is a deep racer with very good VR support plays well with a gamepad.  **Vertigo Remastered** is a very good FPS in the Half Life vein  **Vox Machinae** is a great VR mech shooter','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5lo6xd/'

This game is a buggy pile of sh*t.  Its always been buggy but previously it was at least playable. You might have to deal with your hand models vibrating in game and occasionally your in game model having a seizure but normally this would resolve itself and not cause too many issues. This was my experience on the vive. I was actually able to play the game which was ok. Not nearly as much variety as Pavlov and while the reloading requires a bit more precision than pavlov it also means that vive wand users may find themselves smacking their controllers together IRL because the controls have not taken vive wands into account very well. The game is a by the numbers affair very limited in scope and content it got boring very very quickly. The number of issues on vive controls really shows that devs dont have vive wands and didnt bother testing the controls much. When I first got the game jump and change fire mode WERE THE SAME BUTTON lol. So youd see enemy heads jumping out from behind cover giving their positions away.  It gets far worse though. I got an index HMD and kept my vive wands and the devs seemingly havent accounted for this combination of gear AT ALL. Now when I load the game my character teleports all over the starting room with no hands and no body. Sometimes my flesh will form long fleshpipes that will flicker in and out of existence in a way that is horrible to look at and might induce seizures for some. Cant interact with anything no menus no buttons respond cant play the game at all. And even worse the devs dont give a f*ck either. Its been reported and ignored. But once they have your money they simply dont care. They wont even acknowledge any problems. If the devs decide to take their jobs seriously and fix the problems I will update this review. Its also worth noting that these problems are unique to this game and lots of troubleshooting has been done theres no question of it being a problem on my end. Various other users have also reported the same issues.  Apparently this game is fine on Oculus but if you ever find yourself having technical issues dont expect the devs to do their jobs. They wont and you will have wasted your money. For a pretty mediocre game anyway its probably not worth it. I regret buying this. Ive never left a negative review before but I have given the devs more leeway than is reasonable and theyve still continued to ignore the issues. So you know theyre sh*t when I reluctantly have to write a long negative review.  Also worth noting that the community for this game is toxic AF. And I have NEVER had complaint about a game community before. Its actually insane this game has the highest concentration of people being a**holes for no apparent reason in any game I have ever played its crazy. One trip to the forums is also like getting eyeball cancer. F*ck this game.','i5lrtqv','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5ls4ok/'

It just got mod support as well so theres a ton of cool maps and a ton of cod maps have been imported.

A single modder can release mods like the Resident Evil and Devil May cry mods that are better than any official VR game including motion controls performance improvements etc.  Why cant a huge corporation even match what a single person does in their spare time? Most people would rather the money that was spent on crappy low budget indie games be spent porting AAA flatscreen games to VR instead.  Whats worse is that when once every blue moon they decide to port a AAA game like Hitman its terrible. They just dont care.  It takes a tiny amount of resources to make a decent AAA flatscreen to VR port. No one cares about these crappy low budget games because the market is over-saturated with them.

It gave it a very toybox feel. I believe its because everything accurately is very small in relation to what you would normally expect for planets so everything still is within depth range for your eyes which at least to me was jarring.','i5m0ceu','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5mbmro/'

I feel like my interest for Vr is dieing','My general copypasta recommendations (lesser known games)  &nbsp  **Aircar - (flight/driving) - FREE**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1073390/Aircar/  This beautiful experience (not really a game) really pulls off the feeling of flying around a futuristic world well as much as you can with current tech.  Must try at least once  &nbsp  **Final Assault - (rts/moba) - PAID**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/793690/Final_Assault/  This is a personal favourite of mine I love RTS games and Dota 2 for that matter so it combines both into a VR world.  it looks beautiful even with the cartoon style and offers something that is very rare to do in VR.  Please note that it doesnt have infinite replayability due to the A.I and lack of players.  It didnt deserve to be unnoticed  &nbsp  **Doom 3 BFG VR (fps)  -  MOD**  https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/208200/  https://github.com/NPi2Loup/DOOM-3-BFG-VR/releases  This mod is so good it might as well be an official VR game. If you have Doom 3 BFG edition (not default Doom 3) you can play the game fully in VR with controls. Its the second best shooter below Alyx.  &nbsp  **Pokerstars VR (...poker) - FREE**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/886250/PokerStars_VR/  If you like poker you like this.  The most Ive played out of any multiplayer game as well.  It doesn’t teach you how to play Poker so I had to learn from another source.  The currency is also free as well.  &nbsp  **Horizon Vanguard (90’s Arcade shooter) – PAID/DEMO**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/598740/HORIZON_VANGUARD/  https://tain.itch.io/horizon-vanguard  Really fun arcade experience of blasting enemies in a 90’s arcade over the top setting.  Nothing groundbreaking but a relaxing pick up and play VR game.  I will note that it’s very hard (as an arcade should be) and it might be a little overpriced compared to other modern titles. The second link provides a free demo you can try but keep in mind it’s an outdated 2017 build and there are life continues in the full experience.  &nbsp  **Ancient Dungeon - (dungeon crawler) - PAID**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125240/Ancient_Dungeon/  A very fun and addictive dungeon crawler.  It might be similar to other simple indie games but it plays decently and has a lot of features and excellent RNG dungeons that allows a lot of replayability.  &nbsp  **Google Spotlight Videos (360 VR Animations) - FREE**  https://store.steampowered.com/app/882110/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Age_of_Sail/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/476540/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Pearl/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/714580/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Son_of_Jaguar/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/832080/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Back_to_the_Moon/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/750350/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Piggy/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/714780/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Special_Delivery/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/750360/Google_Spotlight_Stories_On_Ice/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/713320/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Sonaria/  https://store.steampowered.com/app/714610/Google_Spotlight_Stories_Rain_or_Shine/  These are a collection of VR animations not games.  But most people don’t know about them but they’re very beautiful to watch.  Some of the videos might have some stuttering problems mostly “Rain or Shine” and “Back to the Moon” so I suggest booting these ones up and closing them 1 min into the video or after the first scene (no more stuttering issues whilst VR is active).  “Son of Jaguar” will have heavy stuttering so let the animation play the whole thing first (5 minutes) then watch it.  It doesn’t 100% fix the stuttering but it greatly reduces it.  &nbsp  **Vivecraft** (minecraft VR mod)   Even if you find Minecraft popular with just younger kids this game is beautiful in VR and a fully made sandbox as well.  &nbsp  **Star Wars Squadrons** (VR support for flight battle sim requires controller/joystick/hotas)  Well made experience although hard to play. Even if you dislike Star Wars its worth it to play for the immersion alone.  &nbsp  **Compound** (Roguelike shooter)  Strong fps game with a pixel-art direction.  Plays well although difficulty can make it a bit repetitive.  This game is always improving with more content being frequently added','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5mdg9w/'

Comfort options fast smooth movement two handed long guns melee grab things from the ground and inventory etc.   Its more than Alyx had.  Any shooter ported the same way (Deus Ex Prey System Shock 2 etc) would be just fine for me.

But most of the games were already announced before and the only exciting games for me were s&s 2 and bonelab and we knew about s&s 2 before.   Like i said it wasnt bad at all i just hoped they would tell a bit more about Assasins creed VR Gta Splinter cell VR or other unexpected bangers so i understand some people (ofc not the guys who say it sucket and was the worst shit ever).

Not enough _______ type of games is what everyone else is thinking.  I have tons of games an Index and a Quest and I still get annoyed with the process of clearing out my play area turning on my PC hooking everything up booting everything up and then playing for 10-20 mins just to shut everything down and disconnect everything. My solution was to try having everything on standby and ready to play or sell it all. I end up using the Quest a lot more because its easier to just turn on play a quick game and turn it back off it just sucks that I cant play the same quality as PC games without all the extra steps also F*** FaceBook.

The Quest2 256GB model alone costs as much as the Neo 3 Link (450€ both dont confuse $ with € pricing). And thats ignoring the headstrap longer battery life and DisplayPort cable that Neo 3 Link has out of the box and thatll cost you an additional 150€ or so to get on Quest2.  The advantage the Quest2 has is that the base Pico Neo 3 is not sold in Europe so Quest2 64GB at 350€ is a lower entry price. However if you import a Pico Neo 3 from China itll cost you around 380€ (price is a bit all over the place) and that still includes the better headstrap and battery so its arguably still a better deal (ignoring all the Chinese you might have to deal with).  Metas aggressive subsidies are very much overrated when it comes to Quest2.  As for Cambria and competition if those BOM prices are real I really dont see whom they want to sell those too. VR is still a struggling niche at $300 at $1000+ its a toy for businesses and a tiny handful of enthusiasts. And the leaked specs so far dont even sound impressive quite the opposite (basically Quest2+pancake+AR cameras).','i5lyaw2','/r/virtualreality/comments/u7wbse/chinese_analyst_pico_will_release_a_pro_headset/i5mjzjk/'

People pay double the amount to buy consoles to have the same type of experiences they have been having since basically Nintendo.  The reason to not buy a Quest 2 now would be the fact that the next better version apparently is coming some time this year.  If $300 means something to you definitely you should NOT be gettin a VR headset. It will not age well in the short term and definitely not the long term. We are still at brick size cell phones stage.

'i5mn48w','2022-04-21 08:37:51','wheelerman','u8ggbu','Meta showcase was wack af','Its not really any better on the Quest subreddit now that the honeymoon hype posts have died down a bit so I dont think its particular to PCVR.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/u81sl0/anybody_else_kinda_feelin_like_this_after_the/   &nbsp   During the 2016 and 2017 days the feeling from the PCVR subreddits was actually much more positive despite the games being *much* rougher than they are now.  It was similar to the Quest subreddits around the time of the Quest 1 and Quest 2 launches with the flood of new users trying VR for the first time and being blown away.  Though it was a smaller community so many were enthusiastic about trying this new thing and the variety of experiences.   &nbsp   But I think the problem is people were sold on a grand vision of short term mass adoption and the game development industry just rushing in to capitalize on it and thus expected that after 6 years things would have progressed much more than they have.  Youve heard it from certain major industry voices time and time again about all of the AAA content theyre investing in the game dev studios theyre buying out and flooding with resources that 10m headsets sold is some special threshold that will result in a gold-rush of AAA developers VR is ready for mass adoption that the industry shift toward a larger and more accessible market ~2018 would change everything etc etc.   &nbsp   And yet we do have well over 10m headsets sold now.  10-12m for Quest 2 several million for Quest 1 5m+ PSVR sales and several million PCVR sales--you technically do have a degree of mass adoption if that is straightforwardly interpreted as meaning many people have bought legitimate VR devices.  But if that is not enough to attract AAA devs on their own accord then from what I can tell the problem is that [the users arent sticking around](https://www..reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/u22ers/new_vr_market_research_26_of_teens_own_a_vr/) (with the vast majority of the aforementioned sales being in the US and there being ~30m teenagers in the US I dont think ~25% teenager market penetration is that unrealistic).  If the users arent sticking around it does not matter how many youve sold: AAA devs still wont care.   &nbsp   &nbsp   That said I agree that people are expecting too much.  The difference I think is that I dont blame them.  This shit was hyped up way too much and they were sold on a completely unrealistic trajectory.  VR user retention/engagement is poor for a variety of reasons (of which content is *one*) and the medium has a long way to go.   &nbsp   Of course it also doesnt help that many people here (which are mostly high end users) got a taste of what the high end could offer VR gaming a little over two years ago (HLA).','i5m1vs0','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8ggbu/meta_showcase_was_wack_af/i5mn48w/'

Not everyone understands this mind you.  For example Im a strong proponent of physical locomotion instead of moving with a joystick. Its a world of difference in immersion and its ever fairer. You are in the game. Its your body its your physical energy. Youre not making the world slide towards you you just go there.  I use Natural Locomotion or VRocker for walk-in-place locomotion. Its absolutely the way to play I recommend it.

The Neo 3 Link is also completely relying on the Steam store (which requires a PC) but the Quest 2 has a huge inventory of standalone compatible experiences and games.

I havent played Into the Radius but I severely doubt its anywhere near as deep as either of them.  I dont really care about menus tbh. If they serve a purpose that makes the game deeper I will always choose to have them. Or if its less of a pain in the arse. I prefer to press a loot all button on a container than to manually pick up 20 items like in saints and sinners. Sure the latter is more immersive but it gets tiring and annoying after the first few times.

Having these objects not behave anything like in reality is extremely immersion breaking for me.  If I press a button and reload just happens then I dont have to worry about it.

GTA-V has a VR mod available if you want something less cartoonish. Try to avoid installing visual mods on top of it though as many of them shift the perspective a bit while driving and make it look weird in VR.  Also playing normal games on a giant 3D virtual monitor can make them more interesting. Helix Vision can do this for older DirectX games if you have an Nvidia graphics card. I played all of Dark Souls 3 this way. Dolphin supports 3D display for GameCube/Wii games if youre into emulation.  I got tired of jogging in place and bending over for video games a while ago. Now I treat my headset as more of a visual interface than a type of gaming and its more comfortable to use while sitting anyway.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5mxacz/'

Set in an anime-inspired fantasy world the one-two punch of casting and blocking are the foundation of the games combat system. As a novice battle mage in the RUINSMAGUS guild of Grand Amnis players will explore the sprawling underground beneath the splendid surface of a booming medieval town.  We want to use VR to bring players closer to the experience of guild membership and the perils of armed magical combat. The full thrills of fantasy lie not only in the projection of force but the [urgency of tactics](https://i.imgur.com/EKbegkH.gif). There are also VR-enhanced slice-of-life delights in store such as interactions with guild members merchants [and their wares](https://i.imgur.com/06Aa1zK.png).  *RUINSMAGUS* is scheduled to release in Summer 2022 on Meta Quest and Steam. Check out the [story trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP6Jws5AzqU) for a glimpse of our magical world!

The controllers are wireless too but that’s not noteworthy as every VR set has that.   The Quest2 *also* happens to be standalone: that means it has a different mode of operation where it operates without a PC playing only Quest games bought from the Quest store (controlled by Facebook).

However Oculus has [right to repair issues](https://reddit.com/comments/jc55v4) while Vive has tons of replacement parts available [is partnering with iFixit](https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/04/26/vive-ifixit-repair-partner/) for even better access their hardware is built extremely well and there are lots of options for incremental upgrades present and future so if durability at a relatively cheap price is your main goal I would recommend a used Vive with a VR-capable PC rather than an Oculus Quest 2. Due to GPU shortages however this works much better in terms of price if you already have a VR-capable PC.   The Quest 2 will probably work though – you should just be prepared for a lot less reparability and to connect it to a PC later in life. If you have both a PC and an Oculus Quest 2 you will also have more content as you will have access to both Quest-exclusive and PCVR content at the same time.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8pldz/headset_longevity/i5npx2s/'

Heres a link to the Valve Developer Wiki specifically for HL:A with topics under Level Design that go over topics like lighting and AI logic: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx_Workshop_Tools  Theres also a pretty extensive crash course series of videos on YouTube for using Hammer specifically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdSDojRatHw&list=PLHSLq5FjjRw0mC-roui0E04GOl9Dnf-Yd&ab_channel=EagleOneDevelopmentTeam  Now me personally I actually prefer Boneworks overall gameplay vs. HL:A - I love the mix of platforming / parkour elements and gunplay a lot. That being said Bonelab is going to need mod tools that are at a minimum on par or better than HL:A and from my personal experience using mod tools for other Unity games (had experience making levels for a game called Intruder) making mods for Unity specifically is not that simple especially when it comes to things like baked lighting and level / AI logic. Source 2 Hammer is specifically designed around making levels so while there might be complex things to learn about Hammer its at least all there out-of-the-box (you only need to understand how to use Hammer if you want to make an HL:A with the base game assets). Unitys editor really isnt built like Hammer (you need to install 3rd party plugins just to be able to prototype / build level geometry directly in the editor) and dont even get me started on the complications of baked lighting in Unity or using CSG geometry and the optimization issues that can cause - both of which are especially important since Bonelab will be on Quest hardware where good performance will be extremely important to maintain.  I guess well know for sure when Bonelab officially launches but Im still somewhat skeptical. More than likely whatever tools are being made for Bonelab modding specifically will have the input of people experienced in modding Boneworks (or at least Id hope so) so maybe well get extensive tools to play around with that dont require as much technical knowledge - but Id be really surprised if that even happens.','i5kmmyw','/r/virtualreality/comments/u81t2i/bonelab_teaser_trailer/i5nraxm/'

For some reason my mods didnt load which I guess is a good thing but you can get a ton of modded maps and the other map (which I didnt showcase) is quite large and is perfect for sniping.  Also I forgot to answer this earlier but sadly there is not really a campaign though I guess Return of the Rotweiners is fairly close since there is a sort of story there and you do go on quests for NPCs as you explore a linear-ish map.','i5q9unu','/r/virtualreality/comments/u81t2i/bonelab_teaser_trailer/i5ris2z/'

I recommend trying out various games to see what they are like in VR. For example Metroid Prime is great but only if you dont move your head at all due to how the reticle works.   Some games like Skies of Arcadia are an epileptic nightmare. Ymmv but games that do work well like Zelda are a fantastic way to reconnect with the games with fresh eyes.','i5oy441','/r/virtualreality/comments/u8eook/any_reccomended_vr_games_that_i_dont_have_i_feel/i5rtle5/'

But.... I hate to break it to you but (*at least right now*) theres probably no chance that any company will be able to make a competitor with the Quest 2 in terms of price at least not without sacrificing either the quality of the headset itself or resorting to data collection.     Facebook makes a majority of their money by selling data and with the required Facebook login they definitely cut the price knowing youd make up for that in sold data. I mean just from what Ive found looking it up apparently Facebook makes nearly a grand off your personal data by the end of each year.     With all of this in mind I dont think theres going to be a Quest competitor from a trust-worthy company for probably a few more years when *hopefully* the price of everything goes down and maybe the hardware standalone headsets need goes down in price.','i5qyvo1','/r/virtualreality/comments/u9as05/dont_make_logos_that_work_perfectly_for_making/i5ru4mw/'

Is this a Quest game?Yes Cactus Cowboy was born on Quest and I a true Quest game and available on AppLab as well. There is no good reason to play the PC Version if you own a Quest since there is no graphical difference. However want to support as much headsets out there as possible. Thats why there is an OpenXR version of the game.  *Are bHaptics and Protube supported?*   Yes! Charge up and feel the war.  *How long was the game in development*?   About a year.  *How many ppl were working on it?*   Essentially just me. A few friends donated some 3D Models and audio lines  *How long is the game?*   I cannot say. It takes me 4h to speedrun it.

FOV is the same between the two. Although the Reverb has a gasket spacer that can come apart at the mid-point so you can move your eyes closer to gain a bit more FOV if you dont wear glasses.  But even doing that both are still in the 90 degree FOV range.  SO FOV is = give or take a couple degrees.  Tracking is better on quest2.    Lynx and Arpara are both on the soon-ish list for new systems coming.  But since neither are out i cant really say how clarity or tracking would compare to either G2 or Q2.','-','/r/virtualreality/comments/u9llwl/should_i_get_a_reverb_g2/i5s8zpa/'

Many have gotten their headsets when they otherwise could not.  However on a macro scale level it made it accessible by brute force by a large company throwing everything behind it to capture the market with artificial price points. They didnt do this to make VR better they did it so they could price out competition and inflate sales. If companies cant compete fairly you will see less development less choices less money thrown into research etc. Thats terrible for any market especially one as new as VR because most companies cant undersell their hardware with hundreds of dollars below profit at the moment.  Lets put the perspective into numbers. The best things I can see from a quick search for the net worth of Valve vs Meta.  Back in 2019 Valve was valued at $10 billion and probably hasnt changed too much from then most likely increasing marginally.  Meta is currently valued at ~$125 billion at the end of 2021.  Recently Meta even had a dip of $30 billion in value on one day alone three times Valves estimated net worth alone lost in a day and they are still operating.  The point here is that other companies cannot bleed the type of money Meta is at any sort of capacity and still function and no other company would want to invest in a market where their competition is gouging prices to be the market leader. Its extremely crude and bad for overall growth to see a company attempt a Monopoly on the market.','i5sc41u','/r/virtualreality/comments/u9as05/dont_make_logos_that_work_perfectly_for_making/i5sgtq9/'

She will be 2 in July and she is the best dog I could ever ask for. Similar to what you had stated from a very young age you can see their natural drive to protect & keep an eye on everything. When mine was about only 3-5 months old she’d follow my girl’s brother’s fully grown German shepherds from a distance & if they came up to me for pets/attention my Akita would come sprinting & jump between us until I pet her & told her it was okay. She’ll always stay between females in my family (my mom girl her mom) & strangers  as well as always being alert for strange noises. She won’t bark but rather will silently investigate it. If there is anything to be alarmed of there’s absolutely never any hesitation or fear. I remember once when she was about 6-7 months old I was at a small kickback & I brought her to socialize. She simply sat/laid by my side until a stranger had walked over. She perked up. No aggression but fully alert. Me & the guy ended up talking & in an attempt to show me a pic tried to hand me his phone & dropped it. Upon hearing the phone drop  my Akita got up on all 4’s head cocked up standing between me & the guy. I gave her a few pats told her good girl & she calmed down. I am 100% certain she would give her life to protect me & her family. However because she has no fear she is not dog or people aggressive. She is extremely tolerant but she is the last dog someone would want to push boundaries with. Which is exactly how an Akita should be. Like you said it’s almost a blessing to simply witness this breed thrive/live. Sounds like we both have some well bred dogs. Hope nothing but happiness & health for both of y’all.','-','/r/dogs/comments/t50jt3/natural_guards_dogs_do_be_different/i2o4beb/'

I got it off of some kid after I asked for it and he gave it to me.

There was another gun that was much longer but mainly the only mechanical difference was that it would spin around as a sign of reloading. The avatar had many different sitting positions. It had gloves with siler rectangle on it (the rectangle had some simble I believe) a tan cloak. That avatar was fairly tall probably 6 foot or around there.

This takes longer to do needs to be done in a certain way and slightly complicates the animations.

It doesnt take much for mods to list where players are. Does he force join you often? If so uninstall any modifications and see if he ever force joins you in privates again.  AFAIK there is no known (public) method for players to force join private lobbies. VRChat has upped their security intensely and it is basically impossible to track people through invite+ and invite instances now. The only likely way someone is doing it is if one of the mods lists your world ID to a server.

Furries have to be accepting of one another because there isnt really a lot of places outside of our own circles where were liked. VRC is one of those interesting examples where we mix with other people somewhat regularly.  Ironically its usually the same reaction when someone actually gets to know some furries better Wow.

Most children wont gain access to their parents credit card to make a $1 purchase - no ID required. That will filter out the majority of the problem with an automated system and that is huge progress to begin with. Additional suggestions to improve on that are to list it on the credit card statement as ADULT CONTENT as mentioned in other comments and have a report minor function that after so many reports the system flags the account for actual ID verification - the frequency of which should be low enough that the original $1 should cover the human labor involved. And if a verified adult willingly lets a minor use their account they can be flagged for that as well and lose their verification.  The point is that if there are ways to accomplish the problem for far less money then why would you prefer the more expensive alternative?','i41u9kz','/r/VRchat/comments/tzq7dc/please_add_a_method_of_age_verification/i41zytp/'

'i424icz','2022-04-09 10:31:14','PiggyThePimp','tzq7dc','Please add a method of age verification','Im mixed. Age verification would be nice but requiring users to send in their ID is a huge breach of privacy and security imo. I dont want my ID kept on vrchat servers for potential hackers to access nor do I want to send my ID to them.  Things arent great but arent as bad as you say. 18+ communities and worlds arent public for younger users to join but there are suggestive worlds like ones emulating strip clubs.   Id prefer things to stay this way over sending in ID. The only time I see kids is when Im hopping public instances which isnt a big deal more just minor annoyance which comes with gaming on the internet at this point.  The communities you talk about absolutely have ways to moderate age Ive been to 18+ communities they make a invite only world with a host account and they only let in accounts they have vetted in their discord. Again by ID again dont like it but much prefer to send a ID with everything blocked except DOB then to have my entire ID stored on a server.   Only thing I would be ok with is as you said a adult fee but I dont see that happening.  And be careful what you wish for because weve seen time and time again platforms cater to children over adults. Instead of an adult zone all these posts will probably have the opposite effect and push VRC to instead crack down and make the entire platform age appropriate.   All VRC does right now is turn a blind eye to it and ban any instance of it that makes it onto a public avatar or world but push come to shove it comes down to whether its more in their interests to go PG13 or have a age gate which parents will probably call them out on and want a completely SFW game for their kids to play as ridiculous as it is.   Also no FBI sting operation is going to shut down a platform thats not how things work.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/tzq7dc/please_add_a_method_of_age_verification/i424icz/'

Let’s say someone is an EU citizen protected by GDPR good chance you have public resources and standards to protect your private data.  According to discords terms of service and privacy policies there is some protection outside of the example of local laws or their trust and safety team’s decisions.  I’m fairly certain it’s not illegal to present an ID as that’s what it’s designed to do. The problem is when third parties store your ID and open themselves to plausible deniability during a data leak or mistake with that storage hence things like GDPR or a state like California and some protections they offer. I know GDPR can implement a maximum fine of 10 million dollars for violations.  Bottom line though is people should definitely not be showing their ID on discord as you’re suggesting.  There is additional problems where discords minimum age is 13-16. So there is an age verification requirement for certain things and that’s actually better completed by what are the current standards for age verification - think steam age checks or web based consent waivers. I think in most cases it’s acceptable but not responsible to assume a 18-21+ are in an age restricted area. Age verification is still not heavily enforced and even the EU with its attempt at modern data privacy laws delay in forcing the porn as an example to force age checks for that content.  Many industries have simply just taken to using credit card transactions as a stopgap at an age verification process. Mostly because with this type of data you’re giving things to the processing company and the entity in question a traceable transaction often with at least a zip code and full name to blame or block if there is any issues.  The statements here may not be completely accurate as I’m not a lawyer who understands these laws and their diverse applications but I’ve setup websites and communities where age verification procedures are part of their onboarding process.','i46wjkw','/r/VRchat/comments/tzq7dc/please_add_a_method_of_age_verification/i472eaq/'

That being said its fully upgradable if you get the chance in the future since thats an AM4 socket so your options are basically any Ryzen 3 5 7 or 9 assuming your motherboard has support for 5000 series AM4. Also assuming the PSU is high enough wattage you should have full range on GPU upgradability if you choose to but you should be able to get as good as a 6600 XT or a RTX 3070 with your current GPU.   Also would like to point out that if it has a lower end Ryzen 5 you might be a little out of luck performance wise.

I dont tell many about it unless they are close friends or others who have the same difficulties I do. That being said my/our body is an open apartment and three of my alters also run around in VR Chat For us its a chance to actually -be- ourselves with people looking past our IRL body which they cannot see. It is painful to have to live a life that isnt your own. Online spaces are where people actually say our names. Our therapist atm has concluded that integration is not for us and that the healthiest approach is to address us as individuals which has never been done with us before.    We are each unique. We embrace this. And it pains me when people well... make a mockery of it by pretending to have it. Because then because were relatively healthy as a system we look like fakers despite where we are now being the result of over a decade \[Im 36.\] of hard work by both us and the professionals who helped us get to where we are now. Were unapologetically individualistic but we worked our asses off to get here and people pretending to have been through struggles like mine can go kick rocks.

So the quest needs adequate lighting.  Also mirrors can affect tracking as well Im unsure why its black screening though. Its possible its losing tracking so it takes you to the play space setup which is black (I think)','i4crwz2','/r/VRchat/comments/u1cpd4/my_gfs_oculus_keeps_glitching/i4cs9fa/'

Sometimes people just have to accept that nobody  especially strangers wants to listen to you bringing everyone else down and sometimes the best way to cheer yourself up is to stop telling everyone else about all your problems all the time. Especially when everyone is just trying to have fun.   Bring yourself up with the good mood don’t bring everyone else down to your bad mood.   That’s something I’ve also personally used in my daily life to help manage my depression better.

Sadly way way too many players on this game are far too accepting of the n-word which means VRChats moderation system becomes useless. For me it just brings back awful memories of literal kids (elementary school) getting harassed by peers growing up in the south US yet everyone nowadays just takes it as some sort of joke.  The worst part is that Ill speak out about it but people will hit back and say that I dont have the right to be offended by the word because Im not black. Like what the hell is that supposed to mean? Im offended because literal kids got beaten up under a chorus of that word and theyre just saying it to be cool.  Its a major reason why I mostly seek out furry LGBTQ+ and smaller community worlds whenever I go public hopping.

Then it just turned into him insecurely bragging about how he makes 15k in a week and mocking people on working wage.

Remeshing can be incredibly useful to use on specifically selected vertices on somewhere very large and relatively flat like the stomach or left and right sides of the back to avoid flattening the spine line (even better to use height mapping for small indentations or raises).   For detailed parts like hands or lips make sure you make use of edge loops and edge rings for the best results in balancing optimization with quality.  Take the Nardoragon for example.  It’s got a giant fluffy neck as well as a tail with fluff at the base and tip of the tail.  It’s one of the most popular models because it looks amazing and it still performs medium on PC.  Nothing without several different clothing options that are toggleable should really get to very poor from poly count.

The way it works is youll get assigned to a random person and you will have exactly 2 minutes to talk to each other.   At the very end of the session every person is put in a big area - and you can connect with your past partners if you wish to do so','i4vftwi','/r/VRchat/comments/u0ujv8/vrchat_weekly_help_thread_post_simple_questions/i4yr7r0/'

When I started vrc I was so shy I never ever requested on somebody. Now I barely overcame those anxieties and thinking like that helps me.  Also in VRC people are more open and direct and socializing is way easier. Engaging into and disengaging out of social interaction is way easier and people are more honest when they dont feel like doing something then irl.  Also see it practical: if they dont want to be joined but forgot to go on red its their fault and they will most likely forgive you. You do a vibe check when you arrive and after you found out they are not in the mood to socialize then you leave again and just visited to say hi. If they are intentionally joinable but rather dont want to hang with _you_ because the chemistry between you two isnt as good as you thought ... and this happens several times in a row ... well then this is the only way to find out. But then you can also just unfriend them.  Friends will enjoy the time you spend with them and be thankful that you visited them. Simply adding somebody to your friendliest alone doesnt make them a friend you have to join them and find out and to build up your friendship.','i4wplnq','/r/VRchat/comments/u4lz49/i_find_it_hard_to_request_invites_to_private/i4z0ryd/'

Thats how they got it to be so long and retain the high data rate.  If youre not using PC vr on capable hardware then you might not notice the difference since your PC wont be trying to push maximum frames.  Its very high quality for a long usb cable BUT...  If youre questioning whether or not to skimp out on this cable your pc probably isnt capable anyways....thats why they get away with selling them for so cheap.  When you open the oculus app or the developer app (forgot which) it actually does a thruput test and shows exactly how many Mbps your chosen cable is capable of.  tldr:  not all usb cables are created equally...but you might not need the best one if your computer cant push that many frames anyways  also the official link cable wont charge while you play it only reduces the rate of discharge  strongly recommend using airlink instead of buying any link cables just get one that can charge your headset from a battery bank instead','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u4vw5a/official_quest_2_link_cable_vs_unofficial_cable/i4z432k/'

Swapping the left and right tracker in SteamVR also does nothing. It seems like its a data export issue from McFA or VMT isn’t playing nice. If I could rotate the tracking positions a full 180 then all would be fine but as I said changing the rotational offset of my feet in McFA doesn’t seem to do anything only positional offsets seem to work. I will add that once last night instead of being a full 180 off I was only around 90 clockwise off my left tracker was in front of me and my right tracker was at my back. It’s really making me think that something isn’t able to figure out the correct orientation of my HMD.

'i58yrny','2022-04-18 12:47:05','Unknown_Squid','u5wvje','the hidden beauty of vrchat','Whilst theres a huge number of Trans and non-binary individuals that flock to VR-Chat due to the obvious haven that it provides it does still leave your question open regarding the remaining majority of the non-trans female avatar using male playerbase.  You can ask people directly and get a range of mixed answers alongside a fair dose of ambiguous or uncertain answers. Its often more something theyve casually adopted and then resonated with than something explicitly chosen or been drawn to through any distinct motivation. What I mean here is many dont really know their reasons for preferring the female avatars they just know they like being this way. That it works for them.  Many users will claim that theres no good male avatars on offer so they *had to* use a female one. But for anyone that really cared true as it might be that theres less choice theres still plenty out there for anyone who takes more than 30 minutes to look. I know people who have said this and then spent countless hours custom building a female avatar so Im always skeptical of this claim.  Others might argue that these female avatar users must all be eggs (pre self-discovery Trans) and at a glance it could very easily look like such but given the significant majority population of them and the long term use without it leading to a trans end point I dont believe that to be a realistic answer.  The best answer to the phenomenon Ive seen/come to can be summed up fairly well by section 5 of Strazs video here.    Titled *Identity Gender and VRChat (Why is everyone in VR an anime girl?)*   [https://youtu.be/5v\_Dl7i4Bcw?t=2751](https://youtu.be/5v_Dl7i4Bcw?t=2751)  Straz video as a whole is an excellent exploration of the wider subject and well worth watching but its Section 5 that I think really nailed the title question on the head for a more overall majority of the VRC userbase.  The ability to take a softer form in VR-Chat via an avatar and not be judged for it offers men something theyve basically never had in IRL society and are often starved for whether they know it or not. The ability to both express and receive casual affection or emotional empathy in a way that the real world doesnt let them. You cant go into a bar sit down next to some random guy youve never met and hug them whilst they tell you about their rough day and they wont do the same for you either.  But in VR-Chat scenes like this happen all the time. The societal pressure to remain stoic and detached is lifted. It lets people get off the narrow pre-defined railroad expected of male emotions and acceptable interaction and lets them be real people.  Its probably fair to say that theres a spectrum of sorts between Zarekesus answer and Nomadreeds answer here. But the heart of it likely remains similar. Guys just want a chance to be cute to be sexy to be noticed to be talked to to be loved. Theyre tired of being lonely even if theyve trained themselves over the years not to feel it anymore.','i57xtgu','/r/VRchat/comments/u5wvje/the_hidden_beauty_of_vrchat/i58yrny/'

Provided the menus working once youve loaded into the game in desktop mode you should just be able to open the world page on the menu for whatever you want the home world to be and there should be a button on the right saying make home.  If desktop mode is suffering the same menu issue as you were having in vr then you may need to look into clearing your vrchat cache settings/data and verifying the game files.  Unfortunately unlike avatars which you can reset on the website home worlds can only be set from in game.  Another option to try as your playing on steam is opening a world from a direct link to get out of the world your currently stuck in.','i58s14g','/r/VRchat/comments/u6gmyr/im_stuck_in_a_world_and_my_menu_isnt_working_any/i58yscc/'

Change all materials to the Blender default principled bsdf and apply just the main texture to them. That normally fixes things but sometimes you have to make a new material. Then once those are merged by an atlas if you want to use those other maps you will need to manually merge them as well based off of the newly made atlased main texture and apply both of those within Unity to your shader or choice.','i58vnu2','/r/VRchat/comments/u5zpzx/vrchat_weekly_help_thread_post_simple_questions/i593ynx/'

I have been thinking about picking up on my engineering degree all day so this is further reinforcement for that impetus.  I think the argument about intimacy has some merit. I deal with that irl by biasing heavily towards female friends. Though I am still relatively stoic with them and I am actually comfortable with that.  Plus I more or less appreciate the raw and honest natures specific to the feminine energy. I feel that the female version of being blunt is less posturous and more genuine - less grunt grunt. I dont feel like healthy masculinity necessarily equates to being a caveman though signs of testosterone are a vital piece of the picture intellect is just as vital.  I also feel that the company of the modern male is more treacherous in the context of friendship. I definitely trust females as friends more than males (though most females in the context of a relationship I trust far less than I would a male as a friend).  Maybe the female avatars are a subtle way of selecting for some of the same energy preferences that I choose to surround myself with? Think about it... Any purely testosterone driven caveman would be repelled by a man in a female avatar while females would be more comfortable forming friendships with the more approachable female energy. The tone is set to be less combative and competitive - stuff which I do fully appreciate as an alpha personality type but dont really have time or energy to deal with in trivial social interactions. I save my alpha energy for either the bedroom or road rage or defending my family or property. Anyone else who wants a pissing contest can dribble down their own leg because Ive got more important things to do as an adult.   I think in the end societal norms about male to male interactions have some really stupid conventions and so do female to female ones and maybe the choice of a female avatar by males is sometimes just a way to escape the expectation to participate in those conventions and explore interactions with more freedom - something Ive been doing for years irl by surrounding myself with more females.','i58yrny','/r/VRchat/comments/u5wvje/the_hidden_beauty_of_vrchat/i5950lf/'

Not sure why. I wrote out a lengthy response which i dont want to go to waste so hopefully they dont mind me posting a screenshot of their comment for context with the name removed.*   [*https://gyazo.com/9fa6084e67e50c3d5ca9f1ece668a2fe*](https://gyazo.com/9fa6084e67e50c3d5ca9f1ece668a2fe)  *Please excuse the wall of text. I just find this subject fascinating and like to be / am prone to being perhaps overly comprehensive. Dont take it as an overreaction or anything. If anyone actually reads it kuddos.))*  \---------------------------------  Thats a fair and logical counter point to make but one Id argue actually kind of supports what Ive said here. The disproportionate use of female avatars in MMOs/games has been a thing since the dawn of such games yes growing over time to be seen as an expected norm. And the most common answer has always been that classic If Im going to look at a butt for hundreds of hours... answer. Its an answer that still frequently gets stated in VR-Chat too.  And whilst theres obviously always been some truth to it personally Ive always had my suspicions about it even in those older games. The way people often act adopt flirtier/cuter chat habits roleplay etc had always stuck me as notably unique in the social aspect of those games. Thats not just sexulising/objectifying a character on screen thats injecting yourself into it adopting and immersing into it. And its never been uncommon exactly even in the oldest days of MMOs where player characters looked like angular low res abstract art.  I never had enough evidence to really support it properly but I always had this nagging feeling that the I just want to look at a butt answer was as often as not more of an excuse that the entire reality of it. That maybe the person saying such didnt even know why specifically themselves but that there was something more to it. And because heaven forbid in those days that someone would dare to admit to themselves or their friends I guess I just like being this way or I like the way people treat me differently.  And now with VR-Chat and the unique VR medium its in I feel like I finally have the extra evidence enough to argue my point more confidently. In VR-Chat you experience your avatar first person theres no butt to look at. You can admire it in a mirror sure but you hardly need to use a female avatar yourself to enjoy the ocean of eye-candy thats already all around you. If guys at large are just adopting a female avatar as their identity purely for the sake of giving each other something to look at that would be a truly remarkable feat of subconscious collective collaboration.  And that word there Identity is also vital to this. In VR-Chat youre not just making some MMO character some hero in a narrative game. Youre selecting/creating your personal avatar your social identity and how you present yourself to others. Many are intimately attached to their avatars in a way that far out strips any regular video game. Youre not just steering it around a world with mouse clicks youre inhabiting its body as your own seeing its face as your own and thats a profound difference compared to the average game or MMO.  And even for the people who are primarily motivated by simple sex appeal its still a far more personal experience. If they want to get a better show out of the hand tailored sexy body theyve built for themself they have to BE that sexy person in the mirror. They have to stand there and physically wiggle their own butt or shake their stuff if they want to see it move. Theyve got to adopt the mannerisms they want to see and then respond accordingly to the attention it inevitably receives. Im sure youve heard the memes about how VR-Chat turns men gay? Theyre not turning that way out of a mere want to see something sexy. They could go to any website for that. Theyre going this way because they want to ***FEEL*** it. Even when its for sexual reasons its still a personal experience centered on the self.  And in the context of the societal expectations/conditioning  we live in I believe its far easier and safer feeling for many to justify these feelings with the well known I just wanna see the butt excuse than to say otherwise. Effectively...*Im not digging this Im just a sleezy guy who likes anime tiddy haha its not appealing to me on an emotional level Im just a* ***normal masculine*** ***guy***\*. Honest haha. Ive spent 5000 hours doing this because I like tits not feelings. Now stop asking awkward questions whilst I hug and headpat my best friend.\*  Its basically yet another shield from being judged because its easier for someone to claim theyre just horny/objectifying women than enjoying embracing a side of themselves theyve never had the chance to experience before. And I cant blame anyone for it and dont even expect many individuals to fully realize or internalize it themselves either. The unusual easy going culture of VR-Chat lets things like this be possible without people having to go through some kind of dramatic personal revelation in advance. They dont need to deliberately pursue it or know why it feels good just that they somehow ended up here and that it does.','i58yrny','/r/VRchat/comments/u5wvje/the_hidden_beauty_of_vrchat/i59ca6j/'

We face many challenges when in real life. We are judged based on our appearance our clothes our race and gender.     But when in virtual reality using VRchat or NEOS you are only judged based on your choice of avatar and the quality of your character.   This helps to break down many social barriers because you never know who you are talking to  what they look like or where they are from unless they tell you.   People can be a mute or use a voice changer so there is no racism sexism or class system.     You get to choose who/what you want to look like and how you are perceived.

Dont worry you wont lose any friends or avatar information as that is all stored on the vrchat servers against your account. Its all the local settings and copies of worlds avatar data that is in the cache so it can access things you visit regularly quicker than downloading it everytime. Unfortunately if there are errors in the local copies vrchat is trying to use it will be trying to use these broken copies rather than get fresh working versions.  If i recall you can get into the games steam settings page by right clicking its entry in the library. There should be buttons to verify the game files there. And may also have an option for clearing cache there too though you can also usually manually clear the cache files too (can usually be found in a folder located at C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\VRChat\vrchat)','i596zpk','/r/VRchat/comments/u6gmyr/im_stuck_in_a_world_and_my_menu_isnt_working_any/i59faqe/'

'i59ib0r','2022-04-18 15:04:28','Unknown_Squid','u5wvje','the hidden beauty of vrchat','I highly recommend learning the proportional editing tool in Blender. Its remarkably useful in general and  will explode the number of assets you can use. Will give you access to other asset pools such as XPS or raw game rips and remove all dependence on matching bases. Theres genuinely no shortage of male assets out there only a shortage within the MMD community specifically. (and even then theres still some great stuff if someone takes a little longer to search and browse. Im always seeing cool male outfits and wondering why Ive never seen anyone use them.)  Not to mention that male assets are generally far easier to work with. Less smooth curves to maintain no awkward variable sized jiggly parts to stretch assets around no 100bone skirts significantly simpler weightpainting etc. Male avatars in my own experience have been so much faster and simpler to work on.  The majority of people who make female avatars arent just uploading unmodified pre-fitted Mikus either. Theres a huge amount of re-modeling outfit fitting and custom craft that goes into them. Theres so many variations and personally tweaked female bases that anything other than pure stock TDA is basically impossible to find a perfectly fitting outfit for. I create my own female avatar myself also and literally everything I use has to be modified to a custom fit.','i59ax2m','/r/VRchat/comments/u5wvje/the_hidden_beauty_of_vrchat/i59ib0r/'

Other comments are correct in that the default scale for unity is 1 meter. With this you can take measurements of your walls convert them to meters and input those numbers into the scale section of the transform. To keep things consistent keep everything top level in the hierarchy because if you nest anything it will change that scale (I am sure there are better ways to do that).   [https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld\_d9758f74-7dcd-4fdb-8340-dc5288aff827](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_d9758f74-7dcd-4fdb-8340-dc5288aff827)  That is my world if you want to take a look. I modeled a lot of the unique assets myself in blender or in Fusion 360. just remember to keep your units consistent and the imports should work fine.  The other issue that your going to run into is your avatar height. You need it to be as close to your true height as possible or when you walk around you will Desync quickly. Creating an avatar and scaling it to your height may be easier then just finding one in the wild.   I walk around in my virtual shop while in my real shop and it is a trip every time. It is really weird seeing a bunch of crazy avatars and characters climb all over my furniture.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u5jurw/room_development/i59j5yg/'

'i5a60ay','2022-04-18 17:59:01','Unknown_Squid','u5wvje','the hidden beauty of vrchat','For re-posing a model use Pose Mode and then just Apply as Rest Pose. I use the CATS plugin for this myself for convenience though theres bound to be a manual method too.  In Blender 2.8 and higher you can choose which armature you pose if you have multiple in the scene so that makes it easy to match poses of clothes to models if they dont match.  Another general recommendation I give to people is to use the Data Transfer modifier to simplify weight painting. It will let you copy weights from one model to another (eg from body to clothes) based on proximity. For most outfits it will do all the hard work for you and then only need smaller touch ups.  To use it for weightpainting youd check Vertex Data and vertex groups like in the screenshot here.

For visitors and new users I only let them have voice and profile pictures. Users - trusted users get avatars and custom animations. Only let your friends have everything cause otherwise you’ll have a lot of moments where you have to figure out where the hell some obnoxious effect or sound is coming from.   This also keeps your framerate somewhat stable. For bonus performance manually disable anime eboy and egirl avatars.

They feel the most natural out of all I tried. I have tried the trackpad with the Vive wands and also the Valve Index but the issue with the Index controllers are that they are sometimes not able to track fingers correctly.  My one tip would be try to do the gestures like you were actually doing them while holding the controllers. Like if you want to do a peace sign just do a peace sign with your hands while holding it if you want to do a rock and roll gesture do the gesture with your hand while holing it. Its really hard to explain but yea thats pretty much how I got used to them when I first got my Rift back then.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u6kkkp/just_got_the_quest_2_and_the_controls_are_killing/i5ae3yf/'

My best guess is that these elements are offset from where your character is but can still interact with portals--activating them in your menu or resetting your avatar places these elements at the world spawn i.e. usually near portals.  Ive had a lot of friends experience this same issue--more prominently with avatars that can ragdoll or freeze in place.

Post simple questions avatar related requests as well as cool worlds to visit here (April 18 2022 to April 24 2022)','Do not worry about having an avatar ripped. Within the first 5 minutes of you uploading any avatar it is already ripped and stored on someones database. No joke not hyperbole there are multiple people out there that setup an automatic system who pulls any/everything off of the VRC API. In game rippers do exist. But you will NEVER know about them! Its flat out impossible unless they walk up to your face and tell you. Iv seen plenty of force clones but only like 1-3 actual rippers in game who made themselves known in my 2 years of playing VRC.  Nothing you do will ever stop your avatar from being ripped. Nothing. So dont worry about it! Odds are no one will want your avatar anyway as there is likely 100 others like it any said ripper will already have. Your 1 avatar is 1 out of 16000. Last time I look it up there was sixteen THOUSAND avatars uploaded to VRChat!  Even if you have a super unique avatar. Even less people will want it. The more unique the more custom the more you an avatar is the less others will want it. Others will certainly *like* it but very few will want it. And those that do will often ask where you got it so they can buy their own or even ask you to make them one if you do commissions.  Personal opinion. The majority of people that are scared of avatar rippers or who say dont use it public tend to be far too obsessive and over protective for their own good. They are also the types who have the most unoptimized avatars in existence and load as much as possible in order to look as good as possible without a single fucking care about anything but their looks. Vanity pure vanity.  Iv made over 60+ avatars now for personal public or as commissions. It isnt worth the stress or headaches worrying over an avatar being ripped. You wont lose anything from it.

Because i like caring for my friends and having the nickname mama.  Because id get ridiculed if i wore a bra IRL just to make it look like i have boobs.  Because id get laughed at for wanting a skirt and thigh highs IRL.  Because... because i want to be pretty.  Maybe im trans maybe not i genuinely havent figured it out myself yet but in VRC i have the freedom to try anything without being judged. And yea just like you said they can so easily take the image of a female in the first place and without judgment.  I wonder what men would do if society dropped those ridiculous social standards.

Vrchat documentation recommends aiming for 5-8mb.   Theres a very good reason for the limit. And also remember its 10mb after build time compression. The limits are due to limited ram on the quest every avatar displayed needs to sit in ram. The larger the avatars are the less of them that can be displayed at any one time. Im sure the 10mb limit was chosen as a best compromise for performance.  Best tip i can give is to stop using 15+ materials each with an 8k texture its just not needed.  Take a leaf out of the old console devs playbook and you realise just how low you can get away with. 10mb is plenty of space to play with for a single avatar.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u70f6h/can_we_increase_the_size_limit_for_quest_models/i5bmic4/'

Public avatars and private worlds animations ect. Even stuff Iv personally deleted months ago are still listed. Its isnt exactly within 5 minutes as I just looked myself up and its missing a few of my recent avatars but it isnt missing many and is about a week or so behind. Several of them including private avatars even have gifs rotating around the entire model showing they do in fact have the files stored on their database.  Needless to say Im not gonna link the site. Not even gonna name the damned thing as both are highly against the rules of this sub. Not even gonna DM it as I dont want you to risk your information trying to use/contact it either. But its 100% a legit thing as isnt exactly something new either as its an API interaction comparable to pulling stats for some shooter. Known about this site for well over a year now and there are bound to be more. Even met 1 guy in game that ripped stuff on the spot and had several terabytes of data for avatars or various models. He simply liked collecting them and seen them as art to be preserved. Then theres the odd force clone client you run into now and then. And dont forget about mods/clients that offer avatar searching as well.  Also seen several worlds in game that allowed you to search for almost any avatar you wanted could only clone public avatars but you could still search for privates. Those dont last long though before being deleted/banned.  It just isnt worth worrying over. I personally like it if people show an interest in my avatars and dont really care if they get ripped. If I see one of my commissioned avatars being used by some rando you bet your ass Im gonna ask questions and/or report it to get the thing removed as I gotta protect my clients. But Im not exactly gonna stress myself over the *idea* of getting avatars ripped. Got enough grey hairs as it is.  Sorry for the multiple walls of text.

Easy enough to fix though. Simply make a copy of the base texture and have everything blacked out but for what you want to glow who should be whited out. You can color or use grey for the glowy areas if you want a pattern or a color boost though.  Since you merged materials you combined the texture sheets into 1.

'i5bqfyy','2022-04-19 03:36:06','LowAspect542','u70f6h','Can we increase the size limit for quest models to 15MB or 20MB?','Most of the new stuff comming in either the osc or ik updates is server side and should have little impact on avatar file sizes. Osc is literally just a controller. The avatar dynamics update is focussed on the avatars and allows more features but most of it is script based and uses basic text to store the config/parameters its not going to increase the filesize in a significant manner. Its going to be more of a cpu hit than ram. The ram hit and file size is mostly filled by audio/visual assets(also why quest avatars arent allowed audio)  which are by far the bulk of an avatar not the text scripts.  Remember your not just loading one avatar at a time but every one in the world and the world assets aswell.  If you go doubling the limit to 20 your potentially adding a significant extra volume of data your trying to load. Performance can already be quite bad in some worlds when its full just asking for a crash when one too many people enter. Can imagine youd also be pretty annoyed if the game is running like crap and crashing all the time. The alternative is to restrict the number of other people you can view and imteract with which seems a rather bad option for a social game.','i5booej','/r/VRchat/comments/u70f6h/can_we_increase_the_size_limit_for_quest_models/i5bqfyy/'

Post simple questions avatar related requests as well as cool worlds to visit here (April 18 2022 to April 24 2022)','Do not worry about having an avatar ripped. Within the first 5 minutes of you uploading any avatar it is already ripped and stored on someones database. No joke not hyperbole there are multiple people out there that setup an automatic system who pulls any/everything off of the VRC API. In game rippers do exist. But you will NEVER know about them! Its flat out impossible unless they walk up to your face and tell you. Iv seen plenty of force clones but only like 1-3 actual rippers in game who made themselves known in my 2 years of playing VRC.  Nothing you do will ever stop your avatar from being ripped. Nothing. So dont worry about it! Odds are no one will want your avatar anyway as there is likely 100 others like it any said ripper will already have. Your 1 avatar is 1 out of 16000. Last time I look it up there was sixteen THOUSAND avatars uploaded to VRChat!  Even if you have a super unique avatar. Even less people will want it. The more unique the more custom the more you an avatar is the less others will want it. Others will certainly *like* it but very few will want it. And those that do will often ask where you got it so they can buy their own or even ask you to make them one if you do commissions.  Personal opinion. The majority of people that are scared of avatar rippers or who say dont use it public tend to be far too obsessive and over protective for their own good. They are also the types who have the most unoptimized avatars in existence and load as much as possible in order to look as good as possible without a single fucking care about anything but their looks. Vanity pure vanity.  Iv made over 60+ avatars now for personal public or as commissions. It isnt worth the stress or headaches worrying over an avatar being ripped. You wont lose anything from it.

Vrchat documentation recommends aiming for 5-8mb.   Theres a very good reason for the limit. And also remember its 10mb after build time compression. The limits are due to limited ram on the quest every avatar displayed needs to sit in ram. The larger the avatars are the less of them that can be displayed at any one time. Im sure the 10mb limit was chosen as a best compromise for performance.  Best tip i can give is to stop using 15+ materials each with an 8k texture its just not needed.  Take a leaf out of the old console devs playbook and you realise just how low you can get away with. 10mb is plenty of space to play with for a single avatar.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u70f6h/can_we_increase_the_size_limit_for_quest_models/i5bmic4/'

Post simple questions avatar related requests as well as cool worlds to visit here (April 18 2022 to April 24 2022)','I know of at least 1 site that has just about the entire VRC database for download. Public avatars and private worlds animations ect. Even stuff Iv personally deleted months ago are still listed. Its isnt exactly within 5 minutes as I just looked myself up and its missing a few of my recent avatars but it isnt missing many and is about a week or so behind. Several of them including private avatars even have gifs rotating around the entire model showing they do in fact have the files stored on their database.  Needless to say Im not gonna link the site. Not even gonna name the damned thing as both are highly against the rules of this sub. Not even gonna DM it as I dont want you to risk your information trying to use/contact it either. But its 100% a legit thing as isnt exactly something new either as its an API interaction comparable to pulling stats for some shooter. Known about this site for well over a year now and there are bound to be more. Even met 1 guy in game that ripped stuff on the spot and had several terabytes of data for avatars or various models. He simply liked collecting them and seen them as art to be preserved. Then theres the odd force clone client you run into now and then. And dont forget about mods/clients that offer avatar searching as well.  Also seen several worlds in game that allowed you to search for almost any avatar you wanted could only clone public avatars but you could still search for privates. Those dont last long though before being deleted/banned.  It just isnt worth worrying over. I personally like it if people show an interest in my avatars and dont really care if they get ripped. If I see one of my commissioned avatars being used by some rando you bet your ass Im gonna ask questions and/or report it to get the thing removed as I gotta protect my clients. But Im not exactly gonna stress myself over the *idea* of getting avatars ripped. Got enough grey hairs as it is.  Sorry for the multiple walls of text. I get wordy when tired and honestly believe that this isnt worth worrying over.','i5bjeik','/r/VRchat/comments/u5zpzx/vrchat_weekly_help_thread_post_simple_questions/i5bolb1/'

Easy enough to fix though. Simply make a copy of the base texture and have everything blacked out but for what you want to glow who should be whited out. You can color or use grey for the glowy areas if you want a pattern or a color boost though.  Since you merged materials you combined the texture sheets into 1. Meaning the old alpha maps are now worthless.

'i5bqfyy','2022-04-19 03:36:06','LowAspect542','u70f6h','Can we increase the size limit for quest models to 15MB or 20MB?','Most of the new stuff comming in either the osc or ik updates is server side and should have little impact on avatar file sizes. Osc is literally just a controller. The avatar dynamics update is focussed on the avatars and allows more features but most of it is script based and uses basic text to store the config/parameters its not going to increase the filesize in a significant manner. Its going to be more of a cpu hit than ram. The ram hit and file size is mostly filled by audio/visual assets(also why quest avatars arent allowed audio)  which are by far the bulk of an avatar not the text scripts.  Remember your not just loading one avatar at a time but every one in the world and the world assets aswell.  If you go doubling the limit to 20 your potentially adding a significant extra volume of data your trying to load. Performance can already be quite bad in some worlds when its full just asking for a crash when one too many people enter. Can imagine youd also be pretty annoyed if the game is running like crap and crashing all the time. The alternative is to restrict the number of other people you can view and imteract with which seems a rather bad option for a social game.','i5booej','/r/VRchat/comments/u70f6h/can_we_increase_the_size_limit_for_quest_models/i5bqfyy/'

Lets say with OSC you want facial tracking or a heart rate sensor to control a blend shape. That requires almost 0 extra size.   With avatar dynamics its a replacement for avatar dynamics with extra logic for contact receivers which also shouldnt require that much extra space.   With avatar dynamics the quest will already be put under more stress than it is currently so adding even more stress when it already barely performs well seems like a bad idea.','i5botvh','/r/VRchat/comments/u70f6h/can_we_increase_the_size_limit_for_quest_models/i5c4res/'

'i5c7318','2022-04-19 06:13:05','Technological_Elite','u71w0p','whats the best vr headset','Depending on your PC if you want better fov and better res. If you get the correct model theres the PiMax 8k.  8k meaning 4k per eye. So its not really 8k as 8k is 4 times the amount of pixels as 4k. Which is actually good since it wont be as heavy on your graphics card.  Theres also apparently a 12k version coming out so I imagine 6k per eye.  However there are cons to these headsets. Theyre LCD they have low refresh rate at native res. And that due to the high 159° FOV you might experience less pixel density than an oculus quest 2.  If you like pixel density high refresh at native res oh and wireless capabilities as others said dont upgrade. Invest in something like full body tracking or upgrading your P.C. even if someone calls you a poor questie what they dont realize is that *its actually a very good headset.*  I do not own one of these PiMax headsets (I own Oculus Quest 2 and play natively) but none the less it is an option. Make sure to do your research on everything you consider and watch multiple reviews on it.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u71w0p/whats_the_best_vr_headset/i5c7318/'

Index controllers are amazing (and have finger tracking) but you can (realitively)easily connect them to your headset through steam VR(obviously youll need base stations because the quest wont track index controllers which is honestly better because your movements will be lose track much less) as for for full body I recommend vive 3.0 trackers (youll need 3) and 2.0 base stations (at least 2 but more is fine if you have a bigger play space)  Couple other things index controllers are rechargeable so no worry for batteries and can use the same base stations as full body.

Its for a tutorial on parent constraints. There is even a two-handed grip that turns off one of the arm trackers.  This system works great but there is one issue. If your hand is not near the sword it flies to your hand.  I think the new Avatar Dynamics would work better. You can have contact spots where the hand touches the sword and something happens. So drawing sheathing and two-handed grips are possible as well.

This usually goes one of two ways: they either turn out to be chill dudes and everything is fine or they start being weird and either try to ERP with people that dont consent to it or they pull out their furry voices and start saying shit like owo uwu or adding nya at the end of everything they say while acting weird as shit.

It stores an authentication token like many applications do. Authentication is not tied into your Steam account unless youre using Steam authentication so of course just logging into a different Steam account isnt going to make you switch accounts when youre authenticating with a VRChat account.  If you want to specify a separate profile to launch as you can add a command line argument in steam or in a shortcut (--profile=#) https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/launch-options . Doing so will let you maintain multiple profiles that will log in to separate accounts and launch into the account you want to.   If you dont want it to log into your account the next time you launch VRChat then actually log out of your account instead of just exiting the game.  Also it not kicking you out for having more than one connected client using your account is on purpose. Thats very much a feature not a bug and one that can be useful for testing content.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u7r2l9/issues_with_account_login/i5ifyhq/'

If youre in publics stick to low-med population instances of maps that arent the most populated overall. Explore. Avoid places like The Black Cat. Be wary of Quest-compatible instances if youre trying to avoid kids (there are adults on Quest but proportionally youre less likely to run into them in Quest compatible worlds than on PC-only worlds). Try to find people who have interests that align with yours and befriend them. Join on them when theyre in a non-public instance. Youll meet their friends who youre consequently more likely to get along with and meet plenty of new people by meeting their friends friends who youre also more likely to get along with than random public users.   If someone is seriously bothering you and you dont want to deal with it just block them and theyll disappear for you. Nothing to lose by doing so.  Im a software engineer and ended up meeting quite a few other devs and artists/creators and spend most of my time in circles like that. Most of them never touch publics -- a huge portion of the player base finds a friends group and disappears from public instances. I still venture out into public instances a couple times a week.  Hopefully the Groups update in the future will make it easier to find like-minded people.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u84aer/in_my_mid_30s_going_to_give_vrchat_a_trywhere_are/i5iur3q/'

VRC is where a lot of the con crowd hangs out because they regularly party and Interact as the either themselves or their sona in the virtual world. Also not to mention most (like me) just use VRC as their con bar anyways.   I came from outside of the con world and I have met many many more furries that have never once been to a con but are more involved in the art side of things. While I dont think its a small minority I feel like it is still a minority in that less than probably 30% or more of furries have never been to a con. Quite possibly even more than that. Just think of how many people read comics and consume pop culture media and how tiny a percentage of those actually go to related conventions like comic con for instance and others like that. We are talking tens to hundreds of millions of people consuming marvel content and being big fans but never once being to a con related to that. Similar deal really. Its only those who get really really involved that do it.    But I do feel as though there is a huge population of furs that really do want to go especially from how things have been nowadays with the community growing and such as well. So I feel the number of con goers is only growing in the overall community size. Im gearing up to tour around to some myself after all and I got involved with Furality this year.','i42hy51','/r/VRchat/comments/tzqq34/screamers_vs_furries/i5iwh78/'

Not how VRChat works. A worlds purpose is defined by the people in it and without a way to label a world no natural coordination can happen sounds like AltspaceVR would be better for you or at least it was the way you describe back when I played it.  There are surely groups you could find that do partake in such debates but I dont know of any and the one I did Endgame (unfortunate name but they were first) stopped doing their meets two years ago. If you want to find a group that does such stuff then checking their discord (which is probably really dead) might give you a hint. https://www.youtube.com/c/ENDGAMEpodcastVR/videos  Also you cant just expect random people to constantly have a meaningful conversation ongoing.','i5irm6a','/r/VRchat/comments/u84aer/in_my_mid_30s_going_to_give_vrchat_a_trywhere_are/i5j7bd3/'

If they have the necessary vr already its good and not too expensive. If not then its expensive. They never specified the vr they used so I offered a suggestion based on the possibility of them having a certain kind of headset. And made sure to specificy its only a good idea if they have said headset.  Yeah its expensive if they have a quest. Hence why I made sure to *specify* that its good if they have a base station vr not a quest.  I personally prefer steam vr fullbody tracking because of its ease of use. And because of how interchangeable parts are. I can use vive or tundra or index or pimax and they all work together using the same base stations.  But the other solutions are good for what they are and are good entry level. Slime is alright but I find it lacking. However thats due to me experiencing proper base station fbt. I doubt someone who hasnt would notice the difference. So its a good entree option either way.','i5ilclj','/r/VRchat/comments/u7q559/affordable_full_body_tracking/i5j7iu8/'

One person is petty and jumps into the other account .... cause its so easy and clearly not password protected. Violated a bunch of TOS to have that account blocked or banned.

The part with youre only a furry if you call yourself one is pretty much because the concept of funny animals (e.g. Disney Garfield etc.) has been well-established before the fandom and while they are somewhat adjacent to stuff people usually call furry its not exactly what the fandoms about.   That and since the fandom has an above-average amount of LGBTQ+ people theyre probably familiar with things like people assuming things about you that arent true or wanting to keep a facet of themselves private until theyre ready for it.  The thing the other poster mentioned about getting called one if you engage with [furry stuff] too much is pretty much a stop kidding yourself and admit it type of deal which is not necessarily nice but somewhat understandable.  ----   ^^**1:** ^^Human-like','i5jp89f','/r/VRchat/comments/u84m1t/too_true/i5jv03e/'

I’ll add a small suggestion. When you first start avoid popular gaming worlds in particular.  Keep in mind VRC is like the early internet. People pretty much say and do whatever they want. On the flip side you can just block them. Be very quick to block someone if they are making your experience unpleasant.   Honestly for me my most common annoyance are clingy people that are annoying. Most of them are early or mid teens. Kids I can identify and block quickly with no issue but teens can sometimes make it to my friends list only to have me block them later when they start getting annoying.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u84aer/in_my_mid_30s_going_to_give_vrchat_a_trywhere_are/i5knj24/'

If it works the way I hope it does Ill be trying to put together a keyboard thatd likely be helpful for this kind of situation.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u8pgci/i_really_want_to_play_but_i_dont_know_how/i5mms26/'
'i5mmt9z','2022-04-21 08:35:51','Karma__a','u8ccv0','How to become a vrCHAT DJ','As far as the complexities of audio in game in correlation to your equipment.   Its a long laundry list of work with programs like Voice-Meter (VB audio) and downloading virtual cable drivers to use as sound sources / pass through for voice-meter(or anything that you desire to use)   Some people have specific equipment like PC sound cards that let them split from their equipment audio chords directly into the PC for Live audio.  There are a lot of ways to go about it But most require a basic understanding of popular mixing programs for people that actively produce songs for a living.   most of the basic tools youll need can be found on [vb-audio.com](https://vb-audio.com) and youll just have to watch some videos on how the programs work.   Once you get that part down You can start redirecting Voicemeter into external programs to add all sorts of effects.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u8ccv0/how_to_become_a_vrchat_dj/i5mmt9z/'

Its a long laundry list of work with programs like Voice-Meter (VB audio) and downloading virtual cable drivers to use as sound sources / pass through for voice-meter(or anything that you desire to use)   Some people have specific equipment like PC sound cards that let them split from their equipment audio chords directly into the PC for Live audio.  There are a lot of ways to go about it But most require a basic understanding of popular mixing programs for people that actively produce songs for a living.   most of the basic tools youll need can be found on [vb-audio.com](https://vb-audio.com) and youll just have to watch some videos on how the programs work.

Its honestly easier to pick up than spoken language if you use signed English as you dont need to learn the grammar (most people use signed English instead of proper ASL in VRChat). Everyone is really nice as well! I cant imagine not being in the sign community anymore.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u8pgci/i_really_want_to_play_but_i_dont_know_how/i5msojp/'

You could use gestures like pointing and other universally understood hand signs to communicate. If a world has markers/pens you could use those to make signs or write words and Ive even seen some hangout worlds with text chat boxes available. It might also help if you find someone to act as a handler or translator of sorts to tell people you are mute and to translate your hand signs for others who might not understand as well (like me Im not to good at reading gestures and hand signs)  Edit: I have a friend who chooses not to speak in most scenarios they keep their phone nearby to use TTS (Text-To-Speech) to communicate as well.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u8pgci/i_really_want_to_play_but_i_dont_know_how/i5n426j/'

It is often not worth or even possible to fix clipping like this.  Normally you should simply delete any/all hidden mesh youd never see. Otherwise its best to make use of shape keys that shrink the skin down to prevent it from clipping out of clothing and adjust your animations accordingly.  Note. When shrinking the skin down you NEED to follow the armature! If you do not then leverage will take effect and cause the skin to clip out. Shrink each part into its respective bones.

They only need to exist be in the proper hierarchy and be slotted in the configuration menu. Those legs you should be able to fit and weight paint all 3 leg bones easy enough anyway. Or spoof the knees.  Have the knee bones there but dont attach the mesh to those bones.

'i5ot8oz','2022-04-21 17:38:10','chewy201','u8wzlq','Everyone remain calm','How would it be seeing how it isnt made yet?  Most of the complaints are due to the differences between how Dynamic Bones and Phys Bones work. It isnt a 1 for 1 convert and remaking the exact settings isnt all that easy.  In my case the conversion broke several animations that toggled DB scripts. Lead to clipping when things jiggled when they shouldnt be. Already fixed a few of them and am waiting for old Clients to ask for their avatars to be updated if they want it.  You should be fine. Better than fine in fact as youre able to start with Phys Bones instead of needing to convert to it.  A good chunk of this can be summed up as I dont like change.','i5onfeq','/r/VRchat/comments/u8wzlq/everyone_remain_calm/i5ot8oz/'

We try to optimize as best as possible especially for new features on Quest. This is a *brand new feature for Quest* and nothing else existed before in its place.   >   >However we have to be very careful. Due to the extreme prevalence of Very Poor avatars on Quest we have far less headroom on the Quest than we expect. We already exceed Metas recommendations for various systems by a pretty big margin and VRChats system-level optimizations are reaching a point of diminishing returns.   >   >To be extremely to-the-point: We have very significant performance problems on the Quest that we constantly push back against and we have no interest in adding in another unlimited factor that would kill performance across the board.   >   >As much as wed like to let people do whatever they want whenever they want weve previously observed that without any hard limits average numbers tend to balloon way out of control without any way for us to reasonably fix the issue.   >   >Thats why weve implemented the limit. If it turns out that its extremely restrictive we can approach it again later-- however I do not think this is likely.   >   >Notably the soft-cap on DynBones on PC has been half of the PB limit for years and most avatar authors have adapted and dropped below that line to ensure theyre performant and that everyone sees their hard work.   >   >Since the PhysBones limits are **double** that DB limit and Quest has never had a system like this before I expect Quest avatar authors to adapt extremely quickly and with very little loss of fidelity.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u91p2a/whats_the_point_in_the_physbones_limiter/i5oz0te/'

I know of only 3 ways to do clothing toggles/swaps.  1 through shape keys to shrink a mesh inside of another.  2 splitting the avatar into several different objects and turning each one on/off as needed.  3 swapping materials/textures to something transparent.  Of those three 1 seems like the best choice for cross platform avatars. 3 would certainly be best for PC avatars but thats impossible to do on Quest for it being unable to do transparency for avatars. And 2 is clearly the worst for a number of reasons.  Is there a 4th/5th option other than dont do that? Outfit swaps (be it for NSFW or SFW) is a large selling point for a lot of avatars.

Your thigh bone in this case is controlling too much of the vertices in the center pelvis below the belly button. If you want it to not clip you have to assign more weight to the hip bone in the V shape that the womans lower pelvis makes. You can blur this as needed to smooth it but know that sometimes a rapid transition is better. Here is an example from one of my own projects.  [https://imgur.com/WAIHCVi](https://imgur.com/WAIHCVi)  Other things I have to say.  * Both the legs and the pants should be using the SAME armature * If you want a dumb solution (but it works) just... move that part of the pants out a hair * How many polys are those pants? Looks like way too many for what they are * Data transfer works the best on similar topologies and poly count try different interpolation modes I use project onto nearest face a lot  Anyway good luck keep at it eventually it will click and you will be able to get it mostly correct first try.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u8yfh9/having_weight_painting_problems_in_blender_the/i5pgp7m/'

It is relatively inefficient to have a single mesh for your avatar with all the blendshapes on it in general since they have to be calculated for every vertex of the mesh. Having a smaller mesh like just the face as its own thing would make the blendshape calculations better (but will add another material render pass for that mesh). Depends on your number of polys and mats.  Also dont use those 300k poly e-girl avatars they are an efficiency nightmare. Make your own or retopo them into 30k. Wonder why your game lags? Thats why.','i5ozmp4','/r/VRchat/comments/u8yfh9/having_weight_painting_problems_in_blender_the/i5phi4l/'

Ive tried putting a data transfer on it and/or merging the armatures to make it easier but it just doesnt seem to work. Does anyone know how to fix this?','Splitting entire outfits into their own avatar is one thing I can agree with. What about stuff thats not entire outfits or the ability to mix/match?  Hats accessories or hand props are one example for small stuff. Would it be better off using shape keys to hide those or give them their own bone and animate through scaling said bones? Dont honestly know if theres a difference between those 2 options.  What about mix/matching outfits? Say you have a Client that wants 3 shirts 2 pants and a (SFW) nude option on a Furry avatar. Thats 4 different top and 3 different bottom options for 12 mix/match choices. Just a shirt and jacket has 4 mix/match choices from both jacket only shirt only and none. Splitting all of those into multiple avatars is gonna quickly multiply things. Then theres the unavoidable NSFW versions wholl multiply things more.  Theres more to why people want to combo outfits or have multiple choice on one avatar than FBT calibration. Its mainly in my experience because they dont want to change avatars in the first place no mater what mode they play in. Clubbing scenes or most events for example tend to frown on changing avatars in general as loading new avatars often causes the most lag. Then theres wanting to save some bandwidth for those that might have data limits or slower net speeds. Lastly you have ease of use and how much faster/easier it is to go into the action menu and change things in seconds compared to 10-30 seconds of scrolling through their the main avatar menu or the wing tabs depending on many uploads they have.  Sorry if Im being annoying asking all of this. Just really would like to know as Iv ranted too much about optimization to not learn what I can and information on topics like this simply doesnt exist or is really hard to find.','i5q0o27','/r/VRchat/comments/u8yfh9/having_weight_painting_problems_in_blender_the/i5q4pyk/'

CPU and GPU utilization is not indicative of a worlds performance at all especially if there is a bottle neck that is holding your performance in a world back. You could be at high cpu and gpu utilization and be getting excellent performance at capped fps in one world while getting low fps in another world while getting low cpu and gpu utilization.  You want to look at cpu and gpu frame times the lower for both the better as it represents how much time your cpu and gpu needs to process each frame and is indicative of a worlds performance. fpsVR is an excellent tool if you have VR to see that information readily. High CPU frametimes is usually indicative of a world with excessive/unoptimized udon scripts too many draw calls etc for example and would cause a bottleneck on your gpu lowering its utilization.   Other tools exist to examine cpu/gpu frametimes such as Intel GPA which is commonly used for examining these kind of things.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u9d1rt/how_to_check_the_performance_of_a_vrchat_world/i5qsqak/'

'i5rxnw6','2022-04-22 10:40:32','murrytmds','u8wzlq','Everyone remain calm','The toggle for dynamic bones only works locally for obvious reasons which means your avatars are still broken for everyone else unless they also have it on. Which obviously would defeat the purpose of physbones  if everyone did it and also probably is a feature that will go away at some point in the future.      Also... some people dont really have the option to not use auto convert? Any avatars you got from a public world you either use the broken version or have a performance hit. People who own the models themselves still are stuck having to trial and error their way through trying to match to the new system a process thats even harder for those who never really learned unity in the first place and are absolutely lost trying to fix this stuff.      Like i dont feel its a big ask that they had put even a little bit of effort into trying to match settings. I honestly could have sworn they said they were going to try to get them in the same ballpark. But even something as simple as the size of the colliders between systems is way off indicating that not a lot of effort was put into the auto convert.       Ultimately it will come down to the community to figure out the general conversion formula which Im sure they will figure out eventually but was work that the devs really should have done in the first place before suddenly dropping this update on people on a thursday with zero warning','i5r14ji','/r/VRchat/comments/u8wzlq/everyone_remain_calm/i5rxnw6/'

They track VERY WELL even with my non-SteamVR headset setup. They stay tracking in both slow movement and fast af movement. The tundra trackers are smaller thus their tracking will be less accurate during faster movements because the sensors on the tracker are closer together. I say for outright tracking performance the Vive trackers are slightly better and are worth the price.   2. As that guy said below the base stations do not plug into your PC in any way. They    plug into a power outlet and get their power from there. In terms of my setup I havent    measured how far apart they are.   3. Full body in my experience doesnt impact performance at all.   4. I always calibrate when I start my play session to have the most accurate positioning.    I may have to recalibrate in OVR Space Calibrator once during the middle of my play    session because I dont have a SteamVR headset. If you have one that is tracked by the    base stations (Vive Index etc) you wont have to calibrate in OVR space calibrator.   5. You can find the tundras on [https://tundra-labs.com/](https://tundra-labs.com/). They however are sold out    and will be sold out for quite a while. If you want full body right now and you dont    mind spending about 30 dollars more the Vive Tracker 3.0s are a phenomenal choice.    You wont regret it.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u9hnm1/questions_about_tundra_trackers/i5s3qqn/'

They saw a downgraded one or a different one perhaps but never one that looked absurdly broken like the creator had no idea what they were doing.      And while some creators certainly wont update their avatars simply because of how many they have put out or they have quit the platform many of them are now rushing to try and fix everything because they had no notice. Rushing and stressing because the devs couldnt be bothered to simply give them a heads up. There is never a reason NOT to give people notice and there is no argument for it being a glaring oversight on the devs part that they failed to do so now.','i5sa8ic','/r/VRchat/comments/u8wzlq/everyone_remain_calm/i5sb6ho/'

Maybe 2 base stations (1 if you have a clear playspace) Dancings and extra stuff (cartwheels backflips) 2-3 base stations. again it all depends on what you want to do with your fullbody!','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u9oohz/what_do_i_actually_need_for_full_body_tracking/i5suz84/'

However I do have a question: did your friend have guardian disabled in their quest system settings? The newest OS update has a bug where the system menu wont show up if it reboots when guardian is disabled.

Which was a link added to every update with quite clear instructions what it was meant for.  Actually surprised people didnt tell you to go there instead.  ---  > Avatar authors will fix it (Kind of a big assumption to make that every avatar will get updates and seems like most of them were taken by surprised with the sudden launch too)   That is definitely a bad take by whoever said that but since the auto convert has been getting better during the beta and it is unlikely that they would stop trying to improve it I dont think it matter all that much in the long term if avatars are updated or not.  And weve got a much Much bigger problem on the horizon in regards to content since a new Unity version would require updating all shaders (or at least all before the avatar dynamics update because I am fairly sure one of the notes was in preparation for that.','i5s7pix','/r/VRchat/comments/u9h3f6/physbones_are_not_bad/i5syamk/'

Also adjusting the bones yourself is not too hard if you have the files. If you have an avatar with hundreds of bones that need to be converted... well that right there is your problem. Either wait for the creators to update the model (ive already had 2 e-mails from gumroad mentioning this as well as certain models not getting updated due to it being too much work) or do it yourself. Theyre not going to change it back at this point unless they find the issue causing this is something they screwed up (unlikely considering the betas now over and this seems to be a widespread thing).

'i5t45mo','2022-04-22 15:36:23','Astro_Alphard','twghpz','What do you think of VRChat as the standard character creation in VR games?','Some of the Asian MMO character creators have gone completely insane these days. While basic body adjustments such as height proportions and sizes of body parts (like eyes nose legs etc.) are easy to adjust and model other things like hair and certain clothing gets much more difficult to model and look natural.   The main reason why hair isnt modular though is due to the physics hair physics is very difficult to get down correctly. Most games only model a few tens of strands from any given hairstyle and those are generally fixed in length due to the need to define collision/range of movement relationships between the strands. Youd need a 3rd or 4th GPU just to do hair physics at a level where it seems believable with stretching and interaction. This is because hair with that fidelity wouldnt be able to be modelled as a simple equations or states but as finite elements. There is some range of adjustment that you can do but anything major ends up looking wrong or being highly computationally intensive.   Clothing is less of a problem since it usually is just mapped to the body. If youre talking about loose fabrics those can be even more time/processor consuming than hair and weve only recently (past 4 years) been able to start simulating loose fabric in real time.   Im absolutely certain we can get different layers of clothes that isnt an issue even with modern video games. Games like Halo Reach and Phantasy Star Online 2 have incredibly detailed character creators and they are a decade old. Skeleton modelling hasnt really changed much in the past 15 years.   Hairstyles are an entirely different story however.','i3ikq48','/r/VRchat/comments/twghpz/what_do_you_think_of_vrchat_as_the_standard/i5t45mo/'

Especially if you’re going to be using a furry model don’t use a standard Nanachi or Rex. Find a world with some free use customs.

Thats without any fixing and totally auto-converted so I think it went pretty good tbh.   The avatar triggers and interactions is freaking insane my friends on quest can play with my ears! haha totally worth a few silly looking avatars for me (the ones I cant update any more). I cant update some older ones unfortunately but luckily Im usually pretty simple with my dynamic bones and just have some hair/tail/ear physics and looking through even my older avatars seem ok.   Welp thats my status report/2 cents Im excited the most about the triggers stuff and the fact that quest people can properly see how cute my cat girls are x3 on a side note I think the IK beta is coming along great too Im excited to see how that goes.

The clipping distance is dependent on the world creator.  What sometimes works is that if you go to a world that has low clipping distance it transfers to the next world you go to. midnight rooftop and movies&chill has low clipping distances.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u9tdgv/is_it_normal_for_the_quick_menu_and_expressions/i5u07ts/'

VRC will use the clipping distance from your main camera. Youll want to set the high bound as low as you can get it when look from one corner of the world to the other and the other as high as it will go while you can still see your avatar and menu. This has a big effect on your z buffer which concentrates resolution at near distances so just lowering the near plane might introduce artifacts (mainly z fighting) for things far away.','i5tzrpl','/r/VRchat/comments/u9tdgv/is_it_normal_for_the_quick_menu_and_expressions/i5u0oke/'

As far as Iv know TDA and MMD communities do not like their content being used in VRChat in general or for commercial use. But they also freely give away those assets for anyone/everyone to have and often have a use in finished works note as well so their own rules can contradict each other at times. A LOT of TDA or MMD assets are in fact stuff ripped out of various video games. The Sims being a big one but its rather common for an asset to have been sourced from somewhere else meaning they themselves have no rights nor claims to those assets.  The fact that those assets are given away for free is a legal grey area. Those communities possibly not owning said assets is another legal nightmare. Then next comes a very important question.  Did that Creator sell those assets or did he/she sell the work put into making them into an avatar?  There is a large difference between those 2 things. Add that said assets are often freely given away and it gets very complex very fast. Selling the assets themselves is NOT legal at all! But selling the service of working on them IS legal! Theres also the fact that the act of combining raw assets can be transformative and making something new.  Physical world examples are comparable to someone gathering junked scrap people throw or give away and turning that into art then selling said art. Are they selling that scrap junk the newly made art or the work put into it all? Does the people who gave away that scrap junk own the rights to that art or the work put into it?  Odds are youll be fine. Theres literal thousands of avatars out there made with MMD or TDA assets. Those assets are shared so much within their own communities that they themselves dont likely know where they came from.','-','/r/VRchat/comments/u9u9aa/is_reselling_tda_parts_for_vrchat_allowed_read/i5u22if/'
