My house has spiders centipedes and other little things. Can you imagine a big spider putting eggs inside your hmd and little spiders stinging your eyes? Or worst: scorpions (there is a video in reddit where a scorpion is alive inside a hmd) :)) Each playing session i do the same ritual and besides the sealed plastic bag i put the hmd and my headphones above a polished alluminium dome with polished alluminium legs (its like those Jetsons skycrapers). Sorry to give you material for nightmares but i want to help you hahaha.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tinuda/how_do_you_store_your_vr/i2zaf1w/'

(If you dont know *Reality Mixer* please see links to my earlier posts at the bottom.)   This update brings the following changes:  * **Attach to tracked devices**: A camera box can be anchored to a tracked device such as a **controller headset or Vive or Tundra tracker**. If the tracked device is attached to e.g. a (real) wireless keyboard you can move the keyboard through your play area and see it when you look at it. Attach a tracker to a swivel chair with wheels and take the chair with you in VR. * **Edit box edges**: Reduce brightness of the sparkling edges or turn off the edges completely. Increase width of the edges which is also used for smooth fade-ins when using a **Cockpit** Box. * **Min/max transparency** of boxes: If you set the maximum opacity of a box to e.g. 50% youll see the VR world pass through the camera box or cockpit increasing the feeling of reality. Great for **Simracing** and Flightsim experiences using **racing wheels** or HOTAS. * Move/drag Box Edit Panel: When editing camera boxes you can now position the panel yourself by dragging it. Use the icon in the top left corner to move the panel.     If you have any questions or comments please let me know here or on the [Steam Forum](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1844610/view/3119312563812829516).

The knuckles are very cool but honestly I dont feel like they make that much of a difference in regard to my gameplay.  I think that might be different for other people though. For instance I play bow and arrow games paint and drawing... and beat saber like games. None of these really need knuckles. Someone that plays Alyx or games like it might prefer the knuckles.  I was never disappointed with the tracking in the OG Vive. I had that first then got a Odyssey + which looked amazing but WMR is clunky and unecessary and the tracking was a deal breaker.  Now... using the Index with a title like Vermillion where Im painting tiny details I think the newer lighthouses matter.  I think you should get the index headset use it with the current Vive Lighthouses and controllers for a bit and just use the experience to inform your decision.','i2zcy4c','/r/Vive/comments/ttfa05/currently_have_a_vive_whats_the_best_steamvr/i2zr4r8/'

(and somewhat of a Pro 2 review)','I went from the OG vive to the Pro with a the lens mod just before the VP2 was announced and released.  IMO the VP1 with the lens mod is definitely a worthy upgrade but Ill also readily admit that if I didnt already have a wireless adapter to go with it I probably would have spent a good deal of time looking at other options and an index is probably what I would have chosen.  To answer your question tho the only real difference between the OG and Vp1 is pixel count.  Colors and blacks are similar to the OG with the lens mod the sweet spot and clarity are improved but its not as dramatic of a difference in the Vp1 as it was in the OG vive. Still worth the effort and money.  All that being said Im still very happy with my wireless Vp1 with index controllers and wont be looking to upgrade it until there are other wireless options besides the quest.','-','/r/Vive/comments/ttszz2/og_vive_to_pro_1_gear_vr_still_a_worthy_upgrade/i2zs13y/'

I may be biased because I’ve always been able to readily look past less than perfect visuals but to me the extra immersion of the index controllers far surpasses what a better headset could do.  I actually start forgetting I’m in vr after about an hour in boneworks whereas before I always knew I had controllers in my hands','-','/r/Vive/comments/ttfa05/currently_have_a_vive_whats_the_best_steamvr/i2zs27m/'

Didnt notice any difference in colors and the colors look great in both headsets.   Its definitely worth upgrading from the OG Vive to VP1 though I feel the OG Vive with DAS strap is more comfortable and less wobbly than the VP1 but still worth it for the increased resolution. I added some padding and 3D parts around the headstrap to stabilize it and its pretty solid now.

The controllers are the biggest game changer. The nuckles are very cool. The headset itself is much much much more comfortable then the vive. The audio from the index is pretty good too. I greatly enjoy not having to wear headphones over my hmd now. It’s so comfortable. Resolution wise honestly for me it’s not huge. It’s much better but not a giant leap. The fov change is nice however. It does not feel like a next gen headset though compared to the og vive. The quality of life improvements and just over all comfort of use are greatly improved.   Tldr: Index is a very comfy heads set with a lot of QoL improvements. The resolution isn’t going to knock you off your socks. It’s a good upgrade though.

'i31oi6b','2022-04-01 16:23:38','Darryl_444','ttzprc','Cant disable reprojection','The way Vive seems to work is that it will only ever render full fps=Hz if your PC can meet or exceed the limit. Otherwise you get half rendered fps plus half interpolated frames resulting in nasty artifacts and an under-utilized GPU. Nothing in between even if you have motion control turned off. Completely different to any other HMD Ive previously owned. Its quite frustrating but the mod makes it more tolerable.  So if on 90Hz then it will show 90fps as long as your PC can meet or exceed rendering 90fps in every situation. Once it cant keep up it drops to 45fps rendered plus the fake frames as mentioned. At 120Hz it drops to 60fps usually. In some cases maybe even 30fps.  For IL-2 Im currently using the following openvr\_fsr settings:  useNIS: false  renderScale: 0.72  sharpness: 1.00  radius: 0.55','i31f95m','/r/Vive/comments/ttzprc/cant_disable_reprojection/i31oi6b/'

There are a few little spots where you use a weapon but its 99% puzzle game. The vast majority of the puzzles are like find X and use it on Y. So nothing super complex and a lot of the stuff makes logical sense so its not like early adventure games where you combine random items in goofy ways.  The environments are really nice and there are some great elements but story wise its kinda shallow. You go places and learn things but in terms of characters you dont really get much. That being said its quite an enjoyable game. The only part that I didnt like was the beginning (specifically on the boat) before you get to the main location. Its just poorly designed and I got stuck fighting these stupid crocodiles for way too long as it wasnt super obvious how to proceed. Its just a really clunky opening and gave me the impression the game was going to be really janky.

Im not here to make videos which are perfect and formal. I like to have fun - its a gaming channel afterall.  Those sounds are called clicking or clicks in the voiceover industry and its something which is annoying to deal with and often needs to be edited out. Everyones mouth anatomy is different and some people (like me) make more clicks when they speak. I got tired of hearing myself make them and kinda freaked out lol.  I figured it would weed out some viewers and thats a risk I am okay taking so that I can express myself. You dont have to like everyones content because everyone enjoys something different. Not everyone will like you and I understand that not everyone will like me and thats fine. Id rather stay true to myself and build an audience who likes me for being me.

It was a fork and I looked through the comments and at the time the reasoning was that VR cost too much and the dev didn’t want to spend the money on it. But years later a Quest 2 is dirt cheap and worth every penny. It would be great if the dev or someone else picked the project back up but I just doubt that will happen the emulation scene is really weird.','i3d4n6h','/r/Vive/comments/apow9o/anyone_tried_dolphin_vr_emulator/i3e4thl/'

There have been guides written which might help (https://xinreality.com/wiki/How_to_Setup_Elite_Dangerous_in_VR). Demanding games in VR always need effort to tweak even with Ampere. But you should be able to get it working smooth in the most part.  TTS is generally a strange affair in VR. Ive logged some hours in it but am not convinced about its suitability for VR despite it being very fun multiplayer.   Not sure also that the HTC effect can be discounted. Do you have run HTC software to get the Cosmos elite to work?  Have you checked your temps? Could it be that your CPU is throttling? That would also make sense that demanding games are not performing as well as you expect.','-','/r/Vive/comments/twkbr9/extremely_laggy_games/i3gvekm/'

'i3lay6y','2022-04-05 22:34:45','Green0Photon','tx96dj','Buying my first VR headset','Do you have a lot of money? Im guessing not because your computer isnt more mid range from a few years ago.  I say this because you cant just buy the VP2 headset itself for $800. You also need to buy two base stations 2.0 (from HTC theyre $200 from Valve theyre $150 but usually sold out) along with preferably Valve Index Controllers ($280 for both cheaper and better than Vive controllers 2018 the blue ones).   Thats $800 + $400 + $280. $1480. I paid this when the VP2 launched. Dunno if it was a good idea -- I like the VP2 despite its many many flaws. But as time as gone on its become a worse and worse idea to get.  A VP2 at full res is more than 4K UHD pixels to push. And not at 60Hz its 120Hz or maybe 90Hz. And yeah you can run it lower and itll have less screendoor effect than lower end headsets but considering what headsets are coming you wouldnt pay more for this in exchange for it being future proof. Its not. Just higher res.  I recommend three things. Quest 2 (though I hate Meta dont get it but the hardware is decent look at Meta shills for more info) HP Reverb G2 or the Valve Index.  Index while a bit old holds up incredibly well. Cheapest way to get into the nicely tracked base station ecosystem with the good controllers. Good for VRChat and stuff.  Reverb G2 is what I truly recommend. Its basically a cheaper Index but newer display and WMR tracking/controllers. That makes it cheaper particularly good for sims but still usable for most VR stuff. Its often on sale for $450 or $500 from the HP store or Microsoft store although its not right now (Id advise waiting).  You physically can play VR. But it doesnt make sense for you to spend so much on a VP2 unless you can afford a better computer. For perspective I have a 3090 a Ryzen 9 5950x and 64GB 3600. In some poorly optimized games the 5950x isnt fast enough (looking at you Subnautica). However in general the 3090 isnt enough. I try and play at max res but still end up needing to turn resolution down in some games. It is what it is.  Your CPU is 6 cores 6 threads. Thats *really* not good. Intel basically didnt get fundamentally faster after 6th gen until a tiny arguable bit in 11th and a decent bit in 12th. But it did get more cores and made hyperthreading standard -- and your lack of it along with only the 6 cores means youre *very* vulnerable to stuttering. Which is especially nauseating in VR. (Meanwhile my 5950x means only driver-related stutters even with tons of other stuff running.)  The 2060 can run VR. Itll definitely be able to run anything a Quest 2 can run standalone. But you dont want to run a Vive Pro 2 on it. A Reverb G2 would need to be turned down either way (but its the only WMR worth getting new). An Index probably too but youll do the best there.  Your system is great for the era it was built for -- 1080p gaming not ultra but should cover most current stuff. But VR is a far reach from that. Its very easy to jump from Quest 2 levels of compute (phone graphics) to 3090 isnt enough. You want those pixels and smoothness and framerate for VR.  You can definitely do it. A used OG Vive kit would probably fit your machine the best. Or a used Vive Pro kit or an Index. Or the Reverb G2 to save some money but also be future proof enough if you plan on upgrading soon.  (Really what you want is to save up money for the sequel to the Valve Index which releases hopefully at the end of the year but realistically probably some time next year. Codename Deckard.)  Id like Vive to release something more competitive than the Vive Pro 2 but its really a competitor to the 8kx which costs $1000 for the headset alone. Thats not your price range.  But yes your computer can do VR. Thankfully were beyond the time of VR being limited to Titan graphics cards where even older weak cards can run it. (In some ways I am more worried about the lack of hyperthreading on your computer.)  I hope this helped.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tx96dj/buying_my_first_vr_headset/i3lay6y/'

And this spec are more than capable than that of course when we are talking about lower res but this machine also delivers at 1080p. I just wanted to know if i meet minimum requirements for VR but if its gonna stutter or drop fps and not be playable at all then i should really just upgrade my pc. For this price i can get decent cpu with new mobo and upgrade ram to 64gb.

The Pro 2 is a very high resolution headset compared to its competitors. And keep in mind that as another comment was saying you will be running a headset at 90 fps not average fps minimum fps. The Pro 2 is also very expensive so I would recommend looking at a quest 2 if you havent tried VR before because it is a genuinely very good headset while also being ridiculously cheap or maybe look at something like an index or reverb for higher end stuff.  I have been running an OG vive off of a GTX 1080 and a 7600k until recently. The 2060 is near identical to a GTX 1080 and while my 7600k wasnt able to keep up sometimes the 9600k is a big leap up and shouldnt have any issues.

The field of view is much more narrow audio lacks bass the head strap isnt nearly as comfortable and the face gasket isnt comfortable. The controllers are decent but nothing special.  However its very affordable and it will still give you an amazing experience. If you see yourself committing to VR then just take the dive and get a Vive Pro 2 or even better a Valve Index Kit since the Index comes with superior audio comfort and controllers. The only downfall (currently) to the Index is that it cannot be run wirelessly but this may still change in the future.  As for your PC its okay.

I really like that addition of detail for immersion! Its sort of making me reconsider choosing the Elite (which uses the HTC Vive wands+base stations). However I cant find much to confirm that this feature is indeed included in the Cosmos controllers.  Can someone with the Cosmos please confirm that the buttons have touch sensitive sensors to let your fingers point and such?  I know a simple solution would be to just switch over and grab an oculus but I dont need no daddy zuck.  Cheers so much!','-','/r/Vive/comments/txkimv/vr_casual_conversation/i3mjl2q/'

I think with VR something important to keep in mind is its not quite like a desktop monitor where you can just reliably assume you can push x amount of frames on y games at z resolution. How games are designed plays into the quality to an incredible degree but youre also not likely going to have as much recourse fine tuning the image to be perfect. which may be a problem if youre srsly concerned about image quality..

Output rendered fps = variable whatever your PC can generate at the moment plus a few evenly spaced repeat frames.  Instead we currently get fps capped at half-refresh and 50% added interpolated frames even when Motion Compensation is turned off (unless you PC can maintain full refresh fps). The resulting motion artifacts (double-vision/ ghosting) are terrible in fast-action scenes (air combat for example). All while my GPU is loafing along at 55% usage.  When my PC cant hit 90fps then Id prefer to see a variable 70-90 fps without artifacts rather than capped 45 fps plus that ghosting BS.

The VP2 is the best VR Device besides the Varjo Aero for around 4k$.  It also depends on the VR games what additional Hardware you are need. If you only want to play cockpit sims like Elite Dangerous/Project Cars2/AMS2 or AC you are fine with just HMD+1 Tracking Station 1.0 (max x2 when 1.0) or 2.0 (only 2.0 is upgrade able to additional 3 Stations) if you want to play with Controllers you should upgrade to atleast 2 Tracking Station and Index Controllers... dont buy this outdate Wands... and dont buy from HTC Store... instead choose a reseller for better waranty.

'i3pj6bt','2022-04-06 18:49:31','Green0Photon','tx96dj','Buying my first VR headset','Its very common to recommend G2 for sims in particular because its the controller tracking and controllers in general that suck. The inside out tracking is fine. So combine it being cheaper than spending stupid money on VP2 plus at least one base station with it actually having a higher ppd and generally being a higher quality headset and you get the G2 as commonly recommended for sims.  Because yes. Normal camera inside out tracking is relatively easy. Its then tracking the controllers from that which nobody can currently really do except for Meta.  Now if youre into Sims and you have money to spend you have more choices. G2 yeah but VP2 8kx and Varjo as well. But VP2 might be too hot on your face when youre at your computer -- Im always cold so Im fine with it but when I do room scale I always play with the fan in front of me. And then the 8kx will he superior for FOV that youre talking about and the Varjo for clarity.  VP2 is in some senses a good mix. But its never my first choice recommendation.  Id also never tell someone to only buy one base station. Setting aside that Im not particularly certain that you can set things up fully or at all with only a single base station (Ive heard its fine starting with two and then removing one) I find it ridiculous to advise someone about VR without them at least having the ability to do room scale. If youre going to spend the $1k for a VP2 and single base station you really should spend enough to actually do VR properly even if it end up not being your thing.

But Im guessing you havent tried one thats capable of it yet.  Im going to tag u/shenye here also as I would love to hear HTC s thoughts on this too.  There are no interpolation artifacts with variable-fps mode HMDs. Ive owned two of them (Rift CV1 and Pimax Artisan) and used them for thousands of hours. Repeated frames dont cause visual distortions double-vision or ghosting just a very tiny lack of smoothness (very slight jerky motion?) at worst. Not an artifact and barely noticeable unless it dips down to like 50 fps rendered on 90Hz. Very acceptable above 70 fps in my experience.  Of course its a totally different situation with Motion Smoothing (Pimax) or ASW (Oculus) turned on. Interpolation artifacts everywhere (wavy objects double-vision / ghosting) and locked at 45 fps rendered (at 90Hz). Switching modes on the fly during game-play reveals the effect quite clearly. Oculus even has hotkeys for this.  But with MS and ASW turned off it doesnt interpolate the missing frames it just repeats them in order to maintain frame times. And at 70-90 fps (at 90Hz) there arent very many of them compared to Vives forcing of 45 fps under the same conditions. And no artifacts at all.  **The Problem:** With my Vive Pro 2 there is currently no setting option to allow similar free-ranging fps operation to avoid ANY artifacts below 90 fps. Turning off Vive Motion Compensation removes some of the artifacts (like wavy objects) but still leaves very obvious double-image / ghosting artifacts for high-speed objects. And the in-game counter is still locked at 45 fps rendered. Unless I can hit 90 fps in some situations but its binary - never stable in between those two like it was in my other HMDs.   So when Im flying past another fighter plane at high speed it appears to have two images slightly offset from each other. So the plane looks like a dragonfly instead of a Spitfire. This is some kind of motion artifact that would not be possible if it was just using repeated frames.  And its not just me. Everyone else with a VP2 who flies the same combat flight sims (IL2 DCS etc) that Ive spoken to on the various forums has said exactly the same thing. A few people have even returned the device because of it. It may not be as noticeable for walking-around-type games like HL:A but I dont play those.  Anyway thats my experience with it. My hope is that HTC may be able to offer an option for this mode like Oculus Pimax HP and others do. Its otherwise a great HMD.','i3qieu7','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3s5qes/'

If such a variable refresh rate exists and it does not just show the old image twice with a little warping then Id be very curious to read how it works and why other companies havent adopted it yet. It sure seems like a hardware thing so assuming the refresh rate of the VP2 is fixed to 90/120 Hz I cannot imagine they can add what you describe on the software level. However I am not a hardware pro so maybe its a possibility and then indeed it would sure be a nice option.  For me Id be okay with forced 45 / 60 fps and motion compensation IMO it is very well done in the HTC software','i3s5qes','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3sampz/'

'i3pj6bt','2022-04-06 18:49:31','Green0Photon','tx96dj','Buying my first VR headset','Its very common to recommend G2 for sims in particular because its the controller tracking and controllers in general that suck. The inside out tracking is fine. So combine it being cheaper than spending stupid money on VP2 plus at least one base station with it actually having a higher ppd and generally being a higher quality headset and you get the G2 as commonly recommended for sims.  Because yes. Normal camera inside out tracking is relatively easy. Its then tracking the controllers from that which nobody can currently really do except for Meta.  Now if youre into Sims and you have money to spend you have more choices. G2 yeah but VP2 8kx and Varjo as well. But VP2 might be too hot on your face when youre at your computer -- Im always cold so Im fine with it but when I do room scale I always play with the fan in front of me. And then the 8kx will he superior for FOV that youre talking about and the Varjo for clarity.  VP2 is in some senses a good mix. But its never my first choice recommendation.  Id also never tell someone to only buy one base station. Setting aside that Im not particularly certain that you can set things up fully or at all with only a single base station (Ive heard its fine starting with two and then removing one) I find it ridiculous to advise someone about VR without them at least having the ability to do room scale. If youre going to spend the $1k for a VP2 and single base station you really should spend enough to actually do VR properly even if it end up not being your thing.

Ensure you have each wireless dongle is maybe a foot or two away from each other. Having them in close proximity to each other can create drift. I had mine on a bookcase with each shelf holding a dongle in a left to right to left orientation. It fixed my drifting issue well.  If you are already doing this this advice might not be helpful.

But Im guessing you havent tried one thats capable of it yet.  Im going to tag u/shenye here also as I would love to hear HTC s thoughts on this too.  There are no interpolation artifacts with variable-fps mode HMDs. Ive owned two of them (Rift CV1 and Pimax Artisan) and used them for thousands of hours. Repeated frames dont cause visual distortions double-vision or ghosting just a very tiny lack of smoothness (very slight jerky motion?) at worst. Not an artifact and barely noticeable unless it dips down to like 50 fps rendered on 90Hz. Very acceptable above 70 fps in my experience.  Of course its a totally different situation with Motion Smoothing (Pimax) or ASW (Oculus) turned on. Interpolation artifacts everywhere (wavy objects double-vision / ghosting) and locked at 45 fps rendered (at 90Hz). Switching modes on the fly during game-play reveals the effect quite clearly. Oculus even has hotkeys for this.  But with MS and ASW turned off it doesnt interpolate the missing frames it just repeats them in order to maintain frame times. And at 70-90 fps (at 90Hz) there arent very many of them compared to Vives forcing of 45 fps under the same conditions. And no artifacts at all.  **The Problem:** With my Vive Pro 2 there is currently no setting option to allow similar free-ranging fps operation to avoid ANY artifacts below 90 fps. Turning off Vive Motion Compensation removes some of the artifacts (like wavy objects) but still leaves very obvious double-image / ghosting artifacts for high-speed objects. And the in-game counter is still locked at 45 fps rendered. Unless I can hit 90 fps in some situations but its binary - never stable in between those two like it was in my other HMDs.   So when Im flying past another fighter plane at high speed it appears to have two images slightly offset from each other. So the plane looks like a dragonfly instead of a Spitfire. This is some kind of motion artifact that would not be possible if it was just using repeated frames.  And its not just me. Everyone else with a VP2 who flies the same combat flight sims (IL2 DCS etc) that Ive spoken to on the various forums has said exactly the same thing. A few people have even returned the device because of it. It may not be as noticeable for walking-around-type games like HL:A but I dont play those.  Anyway thats my experience with it. My hope is that HTC may be able to offer an option for this mode like Oculus Pimax HP and others do. Its otherwise a great HMD.','i3qieu7','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3s5qes/'

If such a variable refresh rate exists and it does not just show the old image twice with a little warping then Id be very curious to read how it works and why other companies havent adopted it yet. It sure seems like a hardware thing so assuming the refresh rate of the VP2 is fixed to 90/120 Hz I cannot imagine they can add what you describe on the software level. However I am not a hardware pro so maybe its a possibility and then indeed it would sure be a nice option.  For me Id be okay with forced 45 / 60 fps and motion compensation IMO it is very well done in the HTC software','i3s5qes','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3sampz/'

The HMD refresh rate does NOT change during use thats always 100% fixed. Just the rendered fps changes which means the frames rendered by the game itself. These are used to fill up the available fixed refresh cycles in combination with interpolated frames (or repeated frames) depending on the mode. So the sum always adds up to the fixed refresh rate. If it was less we would see black screen flashes :-)  But the in-game counter (or utility) will typically just display rendered fps value only.  HMD refresh is always fixed at 90Hz (or 120Hz / whatever depending on the initial selected mode) for all of the different HMDs including Pimax Vive etc. Theres no new technology here at least not in the sense of continuously variable refresh rates for any of these HMD devices. Monitors may be a different story no idea.  So I think it should be fixable via software as already done by others.  Ive tried Vives Motion Compensation too but its also not a good option for fast-moving scenes like combat flight sims. Much worse artifacts than with it turned off plus also the same ones again. Probably fine for other uses but I wouldnt know about that.','i3sampz','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3sqs7e/'

'i3tgbtt','2022-04-07 14:45:17','Darryl_444','txv4mh','Please help raise awareness at HTC so they add a forced locked framerate slider to their software!','Im probably not explaining it very well and I am definitely not an expert. Regardless here is a detailed example that may be more helpful:  The display has a fixed refresh rate of 90 Hz meaning 90 cycles per second. This is the same as saying that it has a required frame time of 1/90 = 11 milliseconds. It requires an image to display every 11 ms.  The software keeps track in real-time of how long it is actually taking the game to render each frame. If this frame render time is taking longer than the required 11 ms on average then it knows it isnt able to keep up with the demand of the HMD. So then it responds according to the selected mode:  1) Repeat some images. It does this on an evenly-distributed basis not just repeating the exact same frame say 9 times in a row at the end of each second. 1 per 66ms 1 per 33 ms whatever is needed by the current frame render time. This action doesnt make the game render its frames any faster or allow the GPU to handle more load it just allows the HMD to meet its required number of frames to display. The GPU is typically almost maxed out already (although it could be limited by CPU instead) and stays that way. Repeated frames cost zero in GPU or CPU load as they arent re-rendered just re-displayed from the memory buffer. The number of repeated frames can change continuously on the fly as the games rendering capacity changes (like in different scenes) always matching the total required to fill the 90 images per second needed by the HMD. The trade-off is less-smooth visual motion due to a few repeated frames in the mix. Vive seems to lack this mode.  2) Add a bunch of interpolated images. This is typically generated by Motion Compensation/MS/ASW although Vive still seems to do something similar even when thats turned off by the user. The software tells the game to only render exactly 45 fps even if it is capable of more. The software then adds interpolated images into the buffer schedule between every rendered image in order to bring the total to 90 per second as needed by the HMD. These interpolated images are much cheaper on processing power compared to rendered ones so the GPU load actually drops from its maximum capacity often by a lot. This usually improves apparent smoothness a little bit compared to repeated frames. But the trade-off is motion artifacts where the interpolation algorithm doesnt quite predict the correct motion needed in between rendered frames. And wasted GPU capacity.  Note: Interpolation / render caps can also happen at lower multiples of refresh rate. Like 30fps (90/3) instead of 45fps (90/2). Then they just add 2 fake frames in between each rendered one instead of just one. Looks even worse of course but maintains smoothness much better than repeated frames (in this extreme case).  In both modes (typically) it can automatically revert back to full native 90fps if it detects that the rendered frame times can support it again (i.e. less than 11 ms). Thus no more added frames are needed for the time being.  And yes I have heard that the Valve Index also suffers from this same Vive-type limitation although Ive never tried one myself. I have also heard that Valves motion smoothing is much better than HTC so it would be fun to have that available for us too.','i3sud2i','/r/Vive/comments/txv4mh/please_help_raise_awareness_at_htc_so_they_add_a/i3tgbtt/'

I still dont believe it myself.  TLDR: as part of troubleshooting power off and disconnect literally *everything* in the room *except* your VR rig. You might be surprised!  Gory details: Had an OG HTC Vive problem where over a few weeks the tracking in the middle of the room kept getting worse and worse until eventually the headset would only maintain tracking in one particular corner. As soon as it moved toward the middle of the room it greyed out.  I swapped lighthouses around rearranged possible WiFi/Bluetooth antennas turned off 2.4G WiFi devices around the entire house you name it--and the headset only worked in one corner of the room even with one lighthouse on the *far* side of the room.  I didnt find the problem until I literally **powered off every** other electronic device in the room *except*  the PC and headset.  The moment I turned off power to my ***Ethernet connected Sophos UTM 120 router*** the headset tracking problem was solved.  The culprit so far as I can tell: a failing 12v DC power supply on a hardwired router has some sort of internal electrical problem (grounding etc) that causes enough interference that the Vive headset or lighthouses are affected.

I dont think I could go back to tethered. I know its pricey but if you can spare the dough.... Other than that Id say that when you do your initial room setup dont drag your controller all the way to the edge of your space. Leave like a 4 buffer. The reason is the VR boundaries that show up will keep you from going outside your space but there will be a bit more space outside of those boundaries to keep you from smashing things by accident or walking into walls.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tzdwii/i_get_my_vive_on_monday_what_are_some_tips_and/i3yhhwg/'

We highly recommend the Gear VR lens mod. Its a little scary but makes an incredible difference. A 6mm face gasket can also greatly improve FOV. The wireless adapter in our experience bottle necked our AMD CPUs had connectivity issues like black and grey screens and got really hot. We installed custom cooling on them but that introduced buzzing and vibrations. Your mileage may vary. The cheapest upgrade with the most benefit would be 6mm or 10mm face gasket. The best upgrade is the Gear VR lens swap. A good all around but expensive upgrade would be index controllers.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tzdwii/i_get_my_vive_on_monday_what_are_some_tips_and/i3ykmym/'

In the ones where I can hear it it either just fades into the background or I use my Apple Earpod headphones which connect to the headset via Bluetooth.  The most recent streaming App is superb! Image quality is off the scale using WiFi 6 200Mbps Quality and max sharpening.  On the FoV side I realised I wasnt wearing the headset correctly - it was too loose. When tightened up a little bit more the FoV is huge.  I have also hacked one of the config files to give me the native headset resolution. (See my thread here: [https://forum.vive.com/topic/12859-rx-ry-2448-a-whole-new-level/](https://forum.vive.com/topic/12859-rx-ry-2448-a-whole-new-level/))  Needless to say this headset is now the best I have ever used and my Vive Pro 1 finally got retired.

Earbuds are good at blocking out ambient noise. Stock OG Vive was the lightest headset of its time. Wands are still optimal for shooters and sword slashers imo.  My VR area is shag carpet with padding underlay I wear socks so the occasional cable step is not as bad as shoes on hardwood would be. I use snap turning in any game that supports it to minimize cable getting underfoot. Ive seen posts from people who broke their cables by winding them up for storage after each session and also by hanging it on a wall hook (causing a sharp bend) so dont do either of those. A high-radius garden hose wall hanger would be better if you cant just leave it on the floor.  Dont expect retinal resolution. You will see pixels you will see screen door less so on darker games. Try the underwater title theBlu which is mostly blue and a bit dark and since only 2% of your eyes cones detect blue your Vive is actually retinal resolution on theBlu and it looks jaw-dropping on an OG Vive.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tzdwii/i_get_my_vive_on_monday_what_are_some_tips_and/i41x6ey/'

The computer needs to know where the camera box is so it can map the correct camera pixels onto the box sides. If youd use QR codes instead of tracked devices the camera needs to decode the QR to be able to calculate where in the world the box is.    When the keyboard is close it would work. When its on your desk and you are on the couch that may be to far away.

If the pass through was always overlaid it would obstruct stuff in the cockpit/out the window and create blindspots.  I understand the desire to have its location known at all times but switching to passthrough mode to locate it or being able to add a symbol to the chaperone bounds would be a more simple solution/ less intensive on the computer.','i42chbs','/r/Vive/comments/tzs3nl/reality_mixer_video_showing_how_to_use_a_tracker/i42gn5s/'

However by doing this Ive noticed that it breaks controller bindings for me itll say: steam is unavailable some features may be disabled so none of my buttons will be binded. Only solution I found for this is to:  1) Run steam as administrator so headset can be detected 2) Once steamvr is running and things are connected shut down steam (not steamvr) and run it again but this time not as administrator and things should work  Its really annoying not sure why things are suddenly so difficult but hopefully it gets fixed soon :/','i466cgf','/r/Vive/comments/tzfedx/headset_not_detected/i4697yx/'

'i41x6ey','2022-04-09 09:41:58','doug141','tzdwii','I get my vive on Monday what are some tips and recommendations for the original vive','I used my OG vive 4 years with original cable and stock setup. Earbuds are good at blocking out ambient noise. Stock OG Vive was the lightest headset of its time. Wands are still optimal for shooters and sword slashers imo.  My VR area is shag carpet with padding underlay I wear socks so the occasional cable step is not as bad as shoes on hardwood would be. I use snap turning in any game that supports it to minimize cable getting underfoot. Ive seen posts from people who broke their cables by winding them up for storage after each session and also by hanging it on a wall hook (causing a sharp bend) so dont do either of those. A high-radius garden hose wall hanger would be better if you cant just leave it on the floor.  Dont expect retinal resolution. You will see pixels you will see screen door less so on darker games. Try the underwater title theBlu which is mostly blue and a bit dark and since only 2% of your eyes cones detect blue your Vive is actually retinal resolution on theBlu and it looks jaw-dropping on an OG Vive.','-','/r/Vive/comments/tzdwii/i_get_my_vive_on_monday_what_are_some_tips_and/i41x6ey/'

The computer needs to know where the camera box is so it can map the correct camera pixels onto the box sides. If youd use QR codes instead of tracked devices the camera needs to decode the QR to be able to calculate where in the world the box is.    When the keyboard is close it would work. When its on your desk and you are on the couch that may be to far away.

If the pass through was always overlaid it would obstruct stuff in the cockpit/out the window and create blindspots.  I understand the desire to have its location known at all times but switching to passthrough mode to locate it or being able to add a symbol to the chaperone bounds would be a more simple solution/ less intensive on the computer.','i42chbs','/r/Vive/comments/tzs3nl/reality_mixer_video_showing_how_to_use_a_tracker/i42gn5s/'

The PCIe card hasnt seen a driver update either.  My own unit does this a little bit and always has. Something you can try to test - does the dropout when looking up occur more often with you facing towards the transceiver antenna? I suspect occlusion by the head tanks the signal strength as it is very high frequency.  (I wish I had a suitable antenna for my SDR such that I could experiment with an actual s-meter but I dont - any antenna I have only goes up to 2-3ghz at the highest - several ghz shy)','-','/r/Vive/comments/u11yla/question_about_vive_wireless_adapter/i49t3nn/'

There are explicit call outs for this.  Pro tip: IR light is still light even if you can’t see it reflects off shiny stuff just like the ROYGBIV stuff.  The lighthouses flicker IR lasers and flash an IR strobe with specific timing. The headset and controllers record the strikes.  As the timing is fixed for the vertical and horizontal sweeps at the light houses and multiple (distant) sensors are used you can use the timing of the sensor hits to calculate position.   Here is decent vid on how it works: https://youtu.be/J54dotTt7k0  So if you know this then it is obvious that additional strikes on the sensor (reflecting off a mirror here) will cause position calculation errors as it is unintended input to the equation.  Likewise strong outdoor lights or tons of strong IR (some lights / but mostly the sun here) will cause issues from increasing signal to noise on the sensors.','-','/r/Vive/comments/u1656i/psa_about_fixing_one_possible_source_of_joycon/i4am9di/'

The benefit of 2.0 is that you can use more base stations.  1.0 only supports 2 base stations 2.0 supports 16 base stations 4 per room.  Unless youre planning to add trackers to your entire house you wont utilize more than 2 base stations.    The 2.0 base stations have a Wider FOV.  If you have a wide play area these base stations will let you utilize more area.  Do you have a Wide play area?    If you decide to have 2 Vive headsets in the same room and use them at the same time the 2.0 base stations will let you have 2 separate play areas without putting a curtain in between them.  Do you plan to have 2 Vive Pros in the same room and use them at the same time?     The ver 2.0 are better than the 1.0 so if you have the money its worth buying them but if youre trying to save some cash thats the best place to cheap out precisely because you probably lose nothing with the cheaper base stations.','-','/r/Vive/comments/u5n00y/htc_vive_pro_full_kit_or_pro_starter_kit/i543hu5/'

I usually make a nice square. 3.drag it from the top left corner off the screen into the bottom right corner or anyhwere you can easily grab that sliver of window left showing while the rest of it is off screen. <MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF THE TOP LEFT TO GRAB IT OR MAKE IT ACTIVE> 4. Check performance. 5. If you click off the active window make sure you click back onto it or if youve lost the window off the screen you can alt tab back to it or click it from the taskbar to make it active.

'i56af35','2022-04-17 22:10:14','krista','u63suk','Base station 2.0 place to purchase?','theres no repairing it if its a v2 (curved) front.   v1 (flat front) you *might* be able to swap out a burnt laser or if the lens popped off put it back but the failure on v2 is not either of those.   ***do not even bother trying the firmware factory calibration bullshit you might find on a forum somewhere***. its not for v2 base stations it wont work and you could erase the calibration data and if possible make it more dead. heck its not even for v1 base stations but for a problem with the v1 beta base stations.   also be warned that the ir lasers are class iiia without the front cover and lens so they can cause permanent eye damage.','i569inm','/r/Vive/comments/u63suk/base_station_20_place_to_purchase/i56af35/'

I think VR support is a major strength of this title.  I do VR in race sims and flight sims but Elite Dangerous seems to be the best VR space sim.  To me it seems to be their strength and they will be missing out on a target market they could excel and dominate in if they drop VR support.  Sometimes I wonder how such a big disconnect occurs between the business leaders of these video game companies and understanding and delivering what their customer base truly wants','-','/r/Vive/comments/lyc8ws/want_vr_on_foot_in_eliteodyssey_come_support_this/i56ap6l/'

I am brand new to VR apart from the Pixel Daydream VR.  I now have a Valve Index with full body tracking.      After just 4 days of playing I am experiencing what I can only explain to be some kind of psychological disconnection from my own body.      I wake up sometimes and look at my hands and although I can see my hands and body it still feels like theyre not apart of me more like a shell I am controlling.      Even as I sit here on the phone typing this it still kind of feels like my hands are make-belief.  Kind of like a Matrix experience.  Nothing scary.. I read that these effects fade after time which sucks because this is kind of cool. :)','-','/r/Vive/comments/4gk1ux/anyone_else_waking_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night/i56ft02/'

I dont know why but I literally had to go into my control panel and go to device manager.  In device manager find your Intel onboard graphics and right click and then go to disable.  It might mess your monitor settings up for a second but dont worry about it Youre only doing this while youre playing steam and steam VR games.  Now put on your headset and go to your PCVR home.  Now any game you  load should be using your Nvidia GPU.  Good luck','-','/r/Vive/comments/m4fvuj/steamvr_using_the_wrong_gpu/i56ktty/'

You could likely look at the code for the tracking and find the exact answers you are looking for. Im assuming you are technically savvy per the info in the post so if its there then it shouldnt be a problem for you to find. I am pretty sure this should at least help a little. 😜','-','/r/Vive/comments/u5yrl2/how_does_the_vive_headset_differentiate_lasers/i56kvog/'

Lighhouses can be repaired by HTC for around 650 DKK so you should probably either get the broken lighthouse repaired or deduct the price by that much or a bit more for the hassle.  So maybe 2000 DKK for the set with the broken lighthouse?','-','/r/Vive/comments/u653q2/help_with_selling_vive/i56q5h8/'
